None of his experience can prepare him for the wild and dangerous characters his salvage uncovers: a wheelchair-riding gangster kingpin hooked on John Wayne westerns; a brilliant bar dancer who can solve calculus problems before breakfast; a trigger-happy cop who shoots criminals with the same nonchalance as if he were grocery shopping; a religious cult that will do anything to protect its totem; and a crack team of rebels searching for the very thing Ike is seeking.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Graphic India", "name": "Mumbai MacGuffin"}]}

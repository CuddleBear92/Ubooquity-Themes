{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "Some old stories never lose their bite... Something's invading the stories of our childhood, leaving death and oblivion in its wake. Now, a motley crew of animal heroes from ancient Indian fables must unite to survive. But first they must find the boy destined to save them, the chosen guardian of the Panchatantra. Thing is... he has no idea they even exist. Vishnu Sharma, would be boy-hero, is too busy playing in online tournaments to care about fighting storybook wars. But when a none-too-fictional talking lion, monkey and bull arrive at his doorstep, Vishnu must choose between protecting the tales of the Panchatantra, or silently standing by as they disappear into storybook history. With naughty boy wizards, cuddly anime-sociopaths, and a not-so-frightful King of the Jungle.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Graphic India", "name": "The Tall Tales of Vishnu Sharma: Panchatantra (Graphic India)"}]}

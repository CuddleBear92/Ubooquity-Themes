{"metadata": [{"name": "Lou", "year": "2016", "description": "Lou is an 11 year old tomboy growing up in a small, working-class town in New England in the 1990s. This one summer it becomes clear that her brother Eddie's boss at the pizza shop is mixed up in some unsavory business. Things become more precarious, until finally Eddie shows up for work to find his boss Joey has vanished. \"Mendes's visuals are accessible and unpretentious with the interplay between characters being particularly deft in approach. Just check out the body language between Lou and Eddie when little brother John goes missing. It's wonderfully realised with a single hug speaking untold volumes about the relationship between the two.\" \u2014Andy Oliver, Broken Frontier", "publisher": "Alternative Comics", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

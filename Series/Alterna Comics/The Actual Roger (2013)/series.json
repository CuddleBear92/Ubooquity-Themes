{"metadata": [{"name": "The Actual Roger", "year": "2013", "description": "Somewhere in suburban L.A., a freak cosmic event suddenly enables nine-year-old Lakers nut Roger Beaman with the ability to fly... but only for about a foot and a half off the ground. In the old days when those things happened the newly empowered could slink off to arctic fortresses, bat caves or newsroom closets and be \"heroic\" when and how they chose, or not at all - well not any more!  On his maiden flight, Roger is stopped by authorities, removed from his home and forced to play side-kick to an actual super-hero who really doesn't seem to want him around. Can things get any worse? Oh yes. Oh yes they can.", "publisher": "Alterna Comics", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

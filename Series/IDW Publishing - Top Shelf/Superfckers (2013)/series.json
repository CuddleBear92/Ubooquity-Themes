{"metadata": [{"type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Top Shelf Productions", "year": "2013", "description": "SuperF****s collects all four fan-favorite issues of Kochalka's beloved series, plus the all-new Jack Krak one-shot! Foul-mouthed, filthy-minded, and completely oblivious, these young 'heroes' do everything but fight crime - they're too busy getting high, hazing the new kids, playing video games, scheming to be team leader, and designing new costumes. A hilariously rude look at what super-powered teens would really be like, SuperF****s is an over-the-top book with its mind in the gutter and its heart on its sleeve.\n\nNOTE: This comic is for adult viewers only, due to sexual content and nudity.", "name": "Superf*ckers"}]}

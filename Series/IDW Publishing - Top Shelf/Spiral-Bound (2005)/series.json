{"metadata": [{"type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Top Shelf Productions", "year": "2005", "description": "With an ensemble cast straight from a box of Animal Crackers, this delightful tale of ambition, morality, and self-discovery is the first major work by extraordinary newcomer Aaron Renier. Drawn in a decidedly beautiful fashion, reminiscent of Richard Scarry and Lewis Trondheim, Renier has given us a fully-realized and compellingly adventurous narrative, at once both achingly naive and profoundly worldly. This tightly crafted graphic novel is the real deal, and will charm your socks off. A remarkable debut. ", "name": "Spiral-Bound"}]}

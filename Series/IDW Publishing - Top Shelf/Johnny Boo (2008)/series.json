This means that he can go \"BOO\" really loudly. His pet ghost named Squiggle has Squiggle Power, which means that he can fly and do really fast loop-the-loops. Together they have the world's greatest ghost adventures! They enthusiastically frolic and roughhouse, having ghost races and drinking melted ice cream, but they often accidently hurt each other's feelings, and have to comfort and console one another. When the giant pink and yellow Ice Cream Monster bumbles into their lives, they go into a mad panic ... until they discover that he's actually quite friendly. But even though he's friendly, he's also completely wild and unpredictable, and he impulsively swallows Squiggle whole. Some wild loop-the-loops from Squiggle inside his stomach cause a bout of uncontrollable burping, and the Ice Cream Monster burps Squiggle up unscathed. But now how do they stop the burping? Johnny Boo's BOO POWER does the trick, of course. Everyone ends up happy, and delighted by the adventure they had together.", "name": "Johnny Boo"}]}

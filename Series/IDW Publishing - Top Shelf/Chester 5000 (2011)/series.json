THE HEROINE: Pricilla, a beautiful woman who knows what she wants...and wants it ALL the time. THE HUSBAND: Robert, a scientist and inventor -- unfortunately, the only thing he can keep on his mind is his work. Ah, but what does a scientist love more than a problem to solve? Some gears, some springs, the proper appendages, a little extra lubricant, and a little extra love and voila! Chester 5000 is born. Chester is the perfect tool to soothe Pricilla's desires... but what if Chester is more than just a machine? What are the consequences of attempting to engineer love? A sepia-toned delight for adult readers of all stripes, Jess Fink's Top Shelf debut reads like a whimsical love-child of steampunk, silent film and erotic comics.", "name": "Chester 5000"}]}

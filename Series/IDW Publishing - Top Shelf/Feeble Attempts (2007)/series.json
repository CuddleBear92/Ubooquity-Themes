It's densely packed with autobiographical musings, political jabs, Jesus, superheroes, funny job stories, childhood goofiness, and...okay, yes, even a little adolescent relationship drama. But only a little, we promise. Another essential addition to your comics library from one of today's funniest cartoonists.", "name": "Feeble Attempts"}]}

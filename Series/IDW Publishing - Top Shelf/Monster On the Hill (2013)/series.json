Funny, original, unexpected. And best of all: excellent monsters!\" -- Jeff Smith, creator of Bone\n\nIn a fantastical 1860s England, every quiet little township is terrorized by a ferocious monster -- much to the townsfolk's delight! Each town's unique monster is a source of local pride, not to mention tourism.\n\nEach town, that is... except for one. Unfortunately for the people of Stoker-on-Avon, their monster isn't quite as impressive. In fact, he's a little down in the dumps. Can the morose Rayburn get a monstrous makeover and become a proper horror? It's up to the eccentric Dr. Charles Wilkie and plucky street urchin Timothy to get him up to snuff, before a greater threat turns the whole town to kindling.\n\nMonsters of all ages are sure to enjoy this tale about life's challenges, the power of friendship, and creative redemption, packed with epic battles and plenty of wild beasts!\n", "name": "Monster On the Hill"}]}

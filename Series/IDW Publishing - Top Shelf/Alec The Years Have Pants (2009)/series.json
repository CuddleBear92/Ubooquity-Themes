{"metadata": [{"type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Top Shelf Productions", "year": "2009", "description": "For the first-time ever, the groundbreaking autobiographical comics of master cartoonist Eddie Campbell are collected in a single volume! Brilliantly observed and profoundly expressed, the Alec stories present a version of Eddie's own life, filtered through the alter ego of \"Alec MacGarry.\" Witness Alec's progression \"from beer to wine\" - wild nights at the pub, existential despair, the hunt for love, the quest for art, becoming a \"responsible breadwinner,\" feeling lost at his own movie premiere, and much more! At every point, the author's uncanny eye for irony and wry self-awareness makes even the smallest occasion into an opportunity for wit and wisdom. This edition collects the previous Alec books, as well as a generous helping of rare and never-before-seen material, including an all-new 35-page book, The Years Have Pants.

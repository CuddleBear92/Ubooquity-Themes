Captains of Industry like Rockefeller, Vanderbilt, Morgan and Carnegie all called the Jekyll area home.  Using this place of grandeur and elegance as a backdrop, an alternate history is explored between the World Wars. A time of great social, political and technological upheaval. A time of ingenuity and anarchy. A time for some of the most brilliant, and horrible, minds of the 20th century to confront each other. And a time of great new heroes and fantastic new machines. The Jekyll Island Chronicles: A Machine Age War is the first in a series of graphic novels. Part historical fact, part clockwork, and part diesel punk, they span an age of furious advancement in machine technology while exploring the span of man's soul \u2013 whether evil or good.\n", "name": "The Jekyll Island Chronicles"}]}

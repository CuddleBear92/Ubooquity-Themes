{"metadata": [{"publisher": "Lion Forge Comics", "year": "2018", "type": "comicSeries", "description": "Author Edouard Cour revisits one of the greatest Greek myths by painting the often-heroic Herakles as, well . . . somewhat of a jerk. Crude and stubborn at times, in little glimpses we meet a man\u2014half-human, after all\u2014with a psychology more complex than he appears, entangled in guilt over the ghosts who have haunted him since childhood. A mournful sadness seizes him as he crosses the fleeting silhouettes of a woman and her three children.  \"Friends or foe, all those who cross his path end up stiff and worm food,\" \u200b\u200bcomments Linos, the ghost of his childhood music teacher. Brimming with pathos and dark humor, this portrait of Herakles is a graphic whirlwind leaving little respite and often revealing beautiful surprises.", "name": "Herakles"}]}

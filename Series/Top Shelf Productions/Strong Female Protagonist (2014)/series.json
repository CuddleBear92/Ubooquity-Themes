It's impossible to escape the past, however, and everyone has their own idea of what it means to be a hero.\n\nStrong Female Protagonist has been published online since 2012, where it attracted a large fan base, and earned positive reviews on sites such as io9, ComicsAlliance, The Beat, and ThinkProgress.

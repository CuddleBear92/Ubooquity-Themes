This December, four-time-offending writer Daniel Kibblesmith (The Late Show with Stephen Colbert) and taser-proof artist Kano (Daredevil) give the Valiant Universe the adjective-worthy superheroes it deserves: QUANTUM AND WOODY!\\nSometimes...you embrace your destiny. And sometimes...you and your trouble-making adopted brother find yourselves trapped in a scientific lab explosion that grants you $@&%ing awesome super-powers. As a result of their accident, Eric and Woody Henderson \u2013 aka Quantum and Woody \u2013 must \"klang\" their wristbands together every 24 hours or both dissipate into nothingness. Which makes superhero-ing pretty awkward when you're not on speaking terms at the moment. See, Eric has been keeping a pretty big secret: He knows who Woody's birth father really is...and where he's been hiding all these years. \\nWith great power comes great sibling rivalry! This winter, you'll believe two men and one goat can split a one-bedroom apartment and still be a credible threat to evil and injustice everywhere when QUANTUM AND WOODY make headlines and take names!\n", "name": "Quantum and Woody!"}]}

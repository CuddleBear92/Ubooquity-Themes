Such is the tradition, when a female combatant enters the fray. When the carnage is complete, the crowd roars its approval as Achillia stands victorious. Now only one match away from winning her freedom, she has begun to gain renown. The women of Rome, suppressed by their husbands and fathers, have noticed.

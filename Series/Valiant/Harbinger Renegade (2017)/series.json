Your neighbor. Your boss. Your best friend. Your kids.\n\nSix months ago, a secret team of renegade whistleblowers leaked the existence of these extraordinarily dangerous individuals to a stunned world. Today, all across the country, crude, DIY psiot activation attempts have left hundreds brain damaged...or worse. The emergence of a new psiot in a community often leads to riots and mass violence. Gun sales are through the roof.\n\nAmerica is terrified of what could happen next.\n\nWith this revolutionary upheaval now in motion, Kris Hathaway, John \"Torque\" Torkelson, Faith \"Zephyr\" Herbert, and Peter Stanchek are about to discover their calling. Together, the HARBINGER RENEGADES are moving from town to town, building their ranks, and subverting authority one mind at a time...and setting out to prove once and for all that behind their power, there has always been a purpose.\n\nThis November, the most fearless superteam in comics is going underground for AN ALL-NEW ONGOING SERIES from rising star Rafer Roberts (A&A: THE ADVENTURES OF ARCHER & ARMSTRONG) and superstar artist Darick Robertson (Happy!, The Boys)!", "name": "Harbinger Renegade"}]}

Oh dear God no, you'd better get out of the way...because here come the Delinquents! Quantum and Woody are the world's worst superhero team. Archer & Armstrong are a mismatched pair of conspiracy-busting adventurers. When a mysterious force collides these ill-suited and irresponsible \"heroes\" for a cross-country race through the darkest corners of American mythology, all hell is bound to break loose. Can two busted pairs become four of a kind in time to defeat the Hobo King, save the day, and make it back home in time for happy hour? Let's hope so...'cause these guys make a really, really bad team. (And you don't even want to know about the goat.)", "name": "The Delinquents"}]}

Original creator Alan Martin and fan-favorite artist Brett Pearson bring Tank Girl into a whole new era.\n\nThe Tank Girl universe begins here. Explore the backstories and secrets behind the world of the post-apocalyptic punk icon. The origins of the mutant kangaroos and Booga himself, revealed in this first arc. 'Summer Holiday' meets 'Damnation Alley'.\n\n\"We get to invent a complex and detailed universe for Tank Girl and her friends to occupy, but it has to be done with humor, not in the generic style of a po-faced movie producer. Thirty years since she sprang to life, and now we find ourselves at the crack of a new dawn for Tank Girl. Characters and stories will carry more weight! More depth! And more stupidity!\" \u2013 Alan Martin\n\"\n", "name": "Tank Girl: Action Alley"}]}

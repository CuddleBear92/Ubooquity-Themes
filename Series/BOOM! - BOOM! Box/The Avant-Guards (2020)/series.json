{"metadata": [{"year": "2020", "description": "Welcome to the Georgia O'Keeffe College of Arts and Subtle Dramatics, an historically all-female school whose population is decidedly more drama geek than jock. Liv, aspiring actor and basketball enthusiast, doesn't understand why she can't be both, but she seems alone in that belief...until Charlie. Charlie is a recent transfer, a star basketball player, and the answer to all of Liv's problems. She'll stop at nothing to get Charlie to join the ragtag group of misfits that make up their fledgling basketball team. Carly Usdin (Heavy Vinyl) and Noah Hayes (Goldie Vance) present a touching tale about finding what you're looking for... on and off the court. ", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "BOOM! - BOOM!

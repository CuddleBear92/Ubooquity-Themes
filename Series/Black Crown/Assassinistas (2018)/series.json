{"metadata": [{"year": "2018", "description": "First there were three: Octavia, Charlotte, and Rosalyn, a trio of badass hit-women who picked up the slack when the going got too real for other so-called top-level assassins. But things happened. Octavia hung up her semi-automatic for a semi-lucrative kidnapping insurance scam. Charlotte chose expensive Chardonnay, love, marriage and, until recently, a baby carriage. And Rosalyn? There's a lot of conspiracies, but according to the federal government, she's simply M.I.A. When a kidnapping hits too close to home, Octavia is forced out of retirement and back into the bounty-hunting business. Down two partners, she recruits her son Dominic and his boyfriend Taylor to aid and abet her in a semester of murder-based work study, where she'll teach them everything she knows (if she can get them to put down the video games, stop making out, and actually focus on the mission already).\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Black Crown", "name": "Assassinistas"}]}

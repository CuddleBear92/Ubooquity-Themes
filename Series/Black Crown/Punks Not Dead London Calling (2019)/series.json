They've made it to London but on their tail are the police, the quirky paranormal investigation agency the Department of Extra-Usual Affairs, and some really freaky magpie monsters, so there's not (much) time for sightseeing. While Fergie tracks down his long-absent father to get answers about his powerful new \"abilities\" (Sid calls them \"psychic grenades\"), DfEUA's old-school mod super spy Dorothy Culpepper and her sensible young partner Asif Baig uncover evidence that links Fergie to the underworld. Fergie's mum Julie and his not-a-girlfriend Natalie also join forces to save Fergie from life in prison... but with a psychopathic serial killer showing an interest, everybody might soon be running out of time. How does any of this connect to a visually searing three-chord apocalypse? Never mind the bollocks\u2014another season of the critical darling PUNKS NOT DEAD is here with endless pints of anarchy and social distortion!

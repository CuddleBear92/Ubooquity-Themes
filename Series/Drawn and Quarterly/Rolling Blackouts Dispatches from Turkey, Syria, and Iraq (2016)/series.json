{"metadata": [{"year": "2016", "description": "Cartoonist Sarah Glidden accompanies her two friends\u2014reporters and founders of a journalism non-profit\u2014as they research potential stories on the effects of the Iraq War on the Middle East and, specifically, the war\u2019s refugees. Joining\u00a0the trio is a childhood friend and former Marine whose past service in Iraq adds an unexpected and sometimes unwelcome viewpoint, both to the people they come across and perhaps even themselves.\n\nAs the crew works their way through Turkey, Iraq, and Syria, Glidden observes the reporters as they ask civilians, refugees, and officials, \u201cWho are you?\u201d Everyone has a story to tell: the Iranian blogger, the United Nations refugee administrator, a taxi driver, the Iraqi refugee deported from the US, the Iraqis seeking refuge in Syria, and even the American Marine. \n\nGlidden (How to Understand Israel in 60 Days or Less) records all that she encounters with a sympathetic and searching eye. Painted in her trademark soft, muted watercolors and written with a self-effacing humor, Rolling Blackouts cements Glidden\u2019s place as one of today\u2019s most original nonfiction voices.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Drawn and Quarterly", "name": "Rolling Blackouts: Dispatches from Turkey, Syria, and Iraq"}]}

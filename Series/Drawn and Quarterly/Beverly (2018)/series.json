Time passes, bodies change sizes, realities blur with fantasies, truths disintegrate, childhood comforts turn uncomfortable. Again and again, the civilized fa\u00e7ades of Nick Drnaso's pitch-perfect suburban landscapes crack in the face of violence and quiet brutality. Drnaso's debut graphic novel leaves you haunted and squirming and longing for more.\"\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Drawn and Quarterly", "name": "Beverly"}]}

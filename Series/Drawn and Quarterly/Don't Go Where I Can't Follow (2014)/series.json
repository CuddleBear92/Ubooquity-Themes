{"metadata": [{"year": "2014", "description": "In this collection of letters, drawings, and photos, Anders Nilsen chronicles a six-year relationship and the illness that brought it to an end. Don\u2019t Go Where I Can\u2019t Follow is an eloquent appreciation of the time the author shared with his fianc\u00e9e, Cheryl Weaver. The story is told using artifacts of the couple\u2019s life together, including early love notes, simple and poetic postcards, tales of their travels in written and comics form, journal entries, and drawings done in the hospital in her final days. It concludes with a beautifully rendered account of Weaver\u2019s memorial that Glen David Gold, writing in the Los Angeles Times, called \u201c16 panels of beauty and grace.\u201d Don\u2019t Go Where I Can\u2019t Follow is a deeply personal romance, and a universal reminder of our mortality and the significance of the relationships we build. Originally published as a limited edition in 2006, this collection includes a new afterword written by Nilsen.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Drawn and Quarterly", "name": "Don't Go Where I Can't Follow"}]}

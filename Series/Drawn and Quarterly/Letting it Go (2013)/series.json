{"metadata": [{"year": "2013", "description": "Miriam Katin has the light hand of a master storyteller in this flowing, expressive, full-color masterpiece.  A Holocaust survivor and mother, Katin's world is turned upside down by the news that her adult son is moving to Berlin, a city she's villainized for the past forty years. As she struggles to accept her son's decision, she visits the city twice, first to see her son and then to attend a museum gala featuring her own artwork. What she witnesses firsthand is a city coming to terms with its traumatic past, much as Katin is herself. Letting It Go is a deft and careful balance: wry, self-deprecating anecdotes counterpoint a serious account of the myriad ways trauma inflects daily existence, both for survivors and for their families.  \n\nKatin's first book, We Are On Our Own, was a memoir of her childhood, detailing how she and her mother hid in the Hungarian countryside, disguising themselves as a peasant woman and her illegitimate child in order to escape the Nazis. The stunning story, along with Katin's gorgeous pencil work, immediately garnered acclaim in the comics world and beyond. With Letting It Go, Katin's storytelling and artistic skills allow her to explore a voice and perspective like no other found in the medium.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Drawn and Quarterly", "name": "Letting it Go"}]}

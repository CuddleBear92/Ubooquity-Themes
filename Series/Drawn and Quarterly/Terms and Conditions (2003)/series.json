{"metadata": [{"year": "2003", "description": "\"Master satirist tackles the contract everyone agrees to but no one reads.\n\nFor his newest project, R. Sikoryak tackles the monstrously and infamously dense legal document, iTunes Terms and Conditions, the contract everyone agrees to but no one reads.  In a word for word 94-page adaptation, Sikoryak hilariously turns the agreement on its head \u2013 each page features an avatar of Apple cofounder and legendary visionary Steve Jobs juxtaposed with a different classic strip such as Mort Walker's Beatle Bailey, or a contemporary graphic novel such as Craig Thompson's Blankets or Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis.\n\nAdapting the legalese of the iTunes Terms and Conditions into another medium seems like an unfathomable undertaking, yet Sikoryak creates a surprisingly readable document, far different from its original, purely textual incarnation and thus proving the accessibility and flexibility of comics. When Sikoryak parodies Kate Beaton's Hark A Vagrant peasant comics with Steve Jobs discussing objectionable material or Homer Simpson as Steve Jobs warning of the penalties of copyright infringement, Terms and Conditions serves as a surreal record of our modern digital age where technology competes with enduringly ironclad mediums.\n\n\"\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Drawn and Quarterly", "name": "Terms and Conditions"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2016", "description": "\"The Guardian cartoonist relates the daily deadpan adventures of the last policeman living on the moon.\n\n\"\"Living on the moon...Whatever were we thinking? ...It seems so silly now.\"\n\nThe lunar colony is slowly winding down, like a small town circumvented by a new super highway. As our hero, the Mooncop, makes his daily rounds, his beat grows ever smaller, the population dwindles. A young girl runs away, a dog breaks off his leash, an automaton wanders off from the Museum of the Moon. Each day that the Mooncop goes to work, life gets a little quieter and a little lonelier.\n\nAs in Goliath, Tom Gauld's retelling of the Bible story, the focus in Gauld's science fiction is personal\u2014no big explosions or grand reveals, just the incremental dissolution of an abandoned project and a person's slow awakening to his own uselessness. Depicted in the distinctive, matter-of-fact style of his beloved Guardian strips, Mooncop is equal parts funny and melancholy. Gauld captures essential truths about humanity, making this a story of the past, present, and future, all in one.\"\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Drawn and Quarterly", "name": "Mooncop"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2005", "description": "\"The definitive collection of the influential comic zine.\n\nJohn Porcellino has long been considered the greatest of all cartoonists coming from the self-publishing and zine movement of the early 1990s. His spare approach with words and pictures focuses on the smallest of details, revealing a wealth of meaning and emotion in everyday events that most of us overlook in our daily hustle and bustle. Since 1989, he has released over sixty-five issues of his self-published comic King-Cat Comics and Stories.\n\nThis large collection focuses on the first fifty issues with extensive endnotes and an index along with selections of all the extra ephemera that makes an individual issue of King-Cat its own unique experience: essays, articles, stories, and letters from friends. Included are over 250 pages of comics ranging from John's earliest scrawls to his later perfectly minimalist delineations. The comics range through all of Porcellino's concerns--family, family pets, the natural world, work, music, romance.\n\nThis book presents an artist who always knew what he wanted to do. King-Cat Classix shows Porcellino's confidence and skill as it grows steadily over the course of fifteen years.\"\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Drawn and Quarterly", "name": "King-Cat Comics"}]}

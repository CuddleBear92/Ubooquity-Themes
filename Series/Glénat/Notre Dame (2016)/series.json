{"metadata": [{"year": "2016", "description": "One of the French top-key novels amazingly adapted into a furious and overwhelming comic.\nWe all know the story: in the Parisian Middle Age, Esmeralda, Gypsy Beauty, dances in front of Notre Dame Cathedral. She involuntary seduces Archdeacon Frollo who tries to catch her with the help of the Hunchback Quasimodo. But Captain Phoebus, true love of Esmeralda, helps her to escape. Robin Recht and Jean Bastide propose a bewitching tale in two parts, with very modern art, fury, passion and despair. Notre Dame is a masterpiece which benefits here of the combined talent of two young but yet major French comics artists.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Gl\u00e9nat in English", "name": "Notre Dame"}]}

Newlevant respects young people's awareness of how class, race, gender, and history impact our experiences, and takes readers seriously enough to give space for personal reflection and growth. Fantastic brushwork, and a great sense of natural light. Highly recommended.\" --Nate Powell, artist of the March trilogy \n\n\"Lushly rendered and thoughtfully written, Newlevant's No Ivy League is comics autobiography at its best: self-aware, socially conscious, critical, and compassionate.\" \u2014Whit Taylor, author of Ghost Stories \n\nWhen 17-year-old Hazel takes a summer job clearing ivy from the forest in Portland, Oregon, the only plan is to earn some extra cash to put toward concert tickets. Homeschooled, affluent, and sheltered, Hazel soon finds that working side by side with at-risk teens leaves no room for comforting illusions of equality and understanding. This uncomfortable and compelling memoir is an important story of a teen's awakening to the racial insularity of the upper class, the power of white privilege, and the hidden history of segregation in Portland.", "name": "No Ivy League"}]}

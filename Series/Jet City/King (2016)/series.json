{"metadata": [{"year": "2016", "description": "\"King kills more Elder Gods by nine than most people kill all day.\"\n\nFrom critically acclaimed comic book writer Joshua Hale Fialkov (The Bunker, Echoes and I, Vampire) and superstar artists Bernard Chang and Marcelo Maiolo (Green Lantern Corps, Batman Beyond) comes a post-apocalyptic action/adventure comedy!\n\nKing just wants what anybody wants: not to get fired, eaten, or forced to mate with a cheetah lady. For Earth\u2019s sole human survivor after the apocalypse, life among Los Angeles\u2019 strange, new populace ain\u2019t easy. Working for the LA Department of Reclamation, King gets a lot of crappy jobs going on quests and searching for artifacts from the \u201cold world,\u201d which can range from the mythical (Excalibur!) to the absurd (an iPod shuffle--which, let's be honest, was a terrible, terrible invention). The commute can be a real pain in the asphalt, too; the 405 freeway is filled with mutants, monsters, mayhem and tentacled Elder Gods. And that\u2019s all before you hit the horrors of the San Fernando Valley. As the world\u2019s freakish inhabitants battle for supremacy, King searches for the \u201cseed of life,\u201d which may give Earth the second chance it probably doesn\u2019t even deserve.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Jet City", "name": "King"}]}

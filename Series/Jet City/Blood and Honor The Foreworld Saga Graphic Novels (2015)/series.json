Across the dark, cold countryside, three valiant warriors quest for a treasure, the likes of which few can comprehend. These three-the mighty grappler, Eadhild; the skilled archer, Coll; and the charming young Valens-are searching for the head of Yvrnn, the sky-god. For, according to legend, the head of Yvrnn will grant its possessors great wisdom and fortune.\n\nThe trio's quest won't be easy, as they must not only contend with Yvrnn's followers who have set obstacles in their paths, but also the mystical creatures and bandits that haunt the roads of Frisia.\n\nSymposium #1-3:\n\nThe Shield-Brethren is a secret martial order that has defended the West for centuries.

Suffice to say, they\u2019ve learned how to make the most of living inside the walled city, and particularly within their \u2019hood. Johnny is the leader of the Kings of HelL.A., a street gang ready to protect its turf against any and all comers\u2014though Johnny may have taken things too far when he crossed Leonard, a former Suicider known as the Coyote. Things are about to get a whole lot more violent.\n\nThe second chapter in Lee Bermejo\u2019s acclaimed SUICIDERS series shows us a completely different side of life in New Angeles. Joining Bermejo for KINGS OF HELL.A. is artist Alessandro Vitti (RED LANTERNS), whose kinetic style perfectly fits SUICIDERS\u2019 brutal landscape.", "name": "Suiciders: Kings of HelL.A."}]}

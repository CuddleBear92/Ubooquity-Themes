If not, consider the case of Kid Eternity. Everyone knows someone like the Kid-the dude who seems just too cool to live. In his case, though, it's true. Kid Eternity is dead, though he tries not to let that cramp his style. In a lot of ways, he's a pretty typical teenager-more interested in the world in his head than in the job at hand, which is to help humanity raise its consciousness and climb the next rung of evolution's ladder. Okay, so the Kid can call on anyone in all history to aid him in his quest, but there we go assuming the Kid's going to notice it when he needs help. The Kid has this small denial problem. When your whole (after)life is just one damned thing after another, you tend to be pretty jaded, and things have to get awfully weird before the Kid gets moving.", "name": "Kid Eternity"}]}

Why, they create new regulations, of course, like the Interspecies Cultural Exchange Accord!\n\nWhen twenty-something Kurusu Kimihito becomes an involuntary \"volunteer\" in the government homestay program for monster girls, his world is turned upside down. A lamia named Miia is sent to live with him, and it's Kimihito's job to make sure the sexy snake girl integrates into everyday life. While cold-blooded Miia is hot for Kimihito, the penalties for interspecies breeding are dire. Even worse, when a buxom centaur girl, and a scantily-clad harpy move into Kimihito's house, what's a full-blooded young man with raging hormones to do?", "name": "Monster Musume"}]}

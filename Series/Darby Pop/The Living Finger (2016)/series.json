But, as soon as Jason helps Wendy secure an unwitting \"host,\" problems arise.  Soon, Jason has collected a bathtub full of corpses, a rightly suspicious sister, and a best friend hellbent on selling Wendy to the highest bidder.  Even worse, Jason is beginning to realize that he may have acted a bit rashly, especially with Wendy proudly displaying an unhealthy fascination with knives.  Is there any way for Jason to set things right without becoming another casualty?", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Darby Pop", "name": "The Living Finger"}]}

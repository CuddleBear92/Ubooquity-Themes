{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "Nicolas De Cr\u00e9cy's unique work of surrealism and fantasy, starring one lonely seal pup lost in a vast and corrupt metropolis. The Devil is everywhere in New York-on-the-Seine.  But the arrival of Diego the Seal in this sinister and soulless port may just change that.  There, Diego is courted by the upper echelons of the city, who want to groom him for the Nobel Prize of Love. Eisner-nominated creator Nicolas De Cr\u00e9cy ( Foligatto,  NBM's  Salvatore ) has created here a totally original world, rich in absurdist humor, and presented in a beautiful tumult of painted colors.

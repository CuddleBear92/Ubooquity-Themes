{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "Before the Metabarons there were the Castakas, a clan of lawless pirates - this is their story.  The Metabarons  recounted the extraordinary saga of the genealogy of the galaxy's ultimate warrior.  But his ancestors also had ancestors.  And far from being noble warriors with an inflexible code, one will discover they were in fact disloyal, vengeful pirates born out of brutality and war. From legendary creator Alexandro Jodorowsky and artist Das Pastoras, and for all of those who dreamt of a sequel to  The Metabarons,  comes instead the origin tale of their first ancestor, Dayal de Castaka.

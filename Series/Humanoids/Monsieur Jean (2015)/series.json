{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "The charming and humorous adventures of a handsome Parisian novelist, as recounted with a uniquely European sensibility. Monsieur Jean is a young writer whose everyday life and its inescapable existential woes are comedically told by the talented team of Dupuy & Berberian, winners of the 2008 Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoul\u00eame.  Whether it's the unexpected visit of an old friend, a trip to his in-laws, the arrival of a child, the frustrations of writer's block, or even dealing with his moody landlady, Monsieur Jean's life and times all share a tenderness and a dash of irony.  A series full of the nostalgia and droll absurdity that invariably come with adulthood. ", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Humanoids", "name": "Monsieur Jean"}]}

{"metadata": [{"name": "Live Oak, With Moss", "year": "2019", "description": "As he was turning forty, Walt Whitman wrote twelve poems in a small handmade book he entitled \u201cLive Oak, With Moss.\u201d The poems were intensely private reflections on his attraction to and affection for other men. They were also Whitman\u2019s most adventurous explorations of the theme of same-sex love, composed decades before the word \u201chomosexual\u201d came into use. This revolutionary, extraordinarily beautiful and passionate cluster of poems was never published by Whitman and has remained unknown to the general public\u2014until now. New York Times bestselling and Caldecott Award\u2013winning illustrator Brian Selznick offers a provocative visual narrative of \u201cLive Oak, With Moss,\u201d and Whitman scholar Karen Karbiener reconstructs the story of the poetic cluster\u2019s creation and destruction. Walt Whitman\u2019s reassembled, reinterpreted Live Oak, With Moss serves as a source of inspiration and a cause for celebration.\n", "publisher": "Abrams \u2013 Abrams ComicArts", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

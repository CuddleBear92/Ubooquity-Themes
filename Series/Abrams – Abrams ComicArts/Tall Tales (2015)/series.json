{"metadata": [{"name": "Tall Tales", "year": "2015", "description": "Tall Tales was an innovative newspaper strip syndicated internationally by the New York Herald Tribune from 1957-1963. Whereas newspaper strips are square, single-panel or multiple-panel horizontal gag cartoons, Al Jaffee, known for the Fold-In in MAD Magazine, once again altered the format of his work to create a vertical strip-the first, and last, in newspaper history. Tall Tales contains the best 120 wordless strips out of over 2,200, scanned from the original files. The book features a new preface by Jaffee and an introduction by Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report.\n", "publisher": "Abrams \u2013 Abrams ComicArts", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

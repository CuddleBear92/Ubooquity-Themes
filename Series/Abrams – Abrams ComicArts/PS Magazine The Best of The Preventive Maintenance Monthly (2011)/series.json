{"metadata": [{"name": "PS Magazine: The Best of The Preventive Maintenance Monthly", "year": "2011", "description": "Will Eisner-- best known for his influential comic book series The Spirit and his groundbreaking graphic novel A Contract with God - believed in the teaching power of comics, and from 1951 to 1971 he produced PS magazine for the U.S. Army. This Preventive Maintenance Monthly (called PS because it was a postscript to the standard technical manuals) was aimed at teaching American soldiers everything about weapons safety for vehicles, aircraft, firearms, and electronics. Eisner illustrated these vital lessons in drawings, pinups, step-by-step guides, and comic strips. This collection contains the best of Eisner's 227 issues of PS, reproduced in a portable digest format. This relatively unknown work by Eisner is finally explored - the missing link between his comic books and his later, more mature graphic novel style.\n", "publisher": "Abrams \u2013 Abrams ComicArts", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

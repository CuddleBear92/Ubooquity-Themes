{"metadata": [{"name": "The Bridge: How the Roeblings Connected Brooklyn to New York", "year": "2018", "description": "More than 130 years after its completion, the Brooklyn Bridge remains one of the most extraordinary landmarks and symbols of Brooklyn and New York City\u2014and the story behind this architectural marvel is just as extraordinary. The Brooklyn Bridge was originally designed by John Augustus Roebling, but it was his son, Washington, and his daughter-in-law, Emily, who oversaw the bridge\u2019s construction. As work on the bridge went on, Washington developed caisson disease, leaving him bedridden for the majority of the bridge\u2019s 14-year construction. Washington\u2019s wife, Emily Roebling, took his place running the work site, deftly assuming the role of chief engineer, supervising the project and overseeing the workers, contractors, a hostile press, and greedy city politicians\u2014an unusual position for a woman to take on at the time. In this inspiring graphic novel, author Peter J. Tomasi and illustrator Sara Duvall show the building of the Brooklyn Bridge as it has never been seen before, and the marriage of the Roeblings\u2014based on intellectual equality and mutual support\u2014that made the construction of this iconic structure possible.", "publisher": "Abrams \u2013 Abrams ComicArts", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

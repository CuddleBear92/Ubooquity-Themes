This may star the first ever war criminal hunter in comic books!\n\nArtist Matthew Weldon is known for his work on Image Comics titles such as the \"Popgun\" anthology and graphic novel, \"New Brighton Archaeological Society\".\n\nWriter Chris Bunting again shows that he is just as much at home writing an edgy thriller as he is with younger reader titles such as \"Tough Guy\" and Marvel UK's \"Action Man\".\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Eco Comics", "name": "Supplanter"}]}

A twist on The Truman Show, Gigantic focuses on a brainwashed, alien superhero deposited on Earth to be the spotlight of an intrusive, around-the-clock television program being filmed without his knowledge. Critically acclaimed writer Rick Remender (Fear Agent, The End League) teams up with groundbreaking artist Eric Nguyen (X-Men, Sandman Mystery Theatre) in the merging of big, visually exciting art with a story examining America's consumer-based culture.  Sci-fi thrills and superhero action from the one and only Rick Remender!", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dark Horse", "name": "Gigantic"}]}

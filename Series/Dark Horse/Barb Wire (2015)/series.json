{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "Steel Harbor is a hell of a town, with the emphasis on hell, an urban wasteland of shuttered factories, decaying neighborhoods, and broken dreams. Crime and street violence are the soup of the day every day, but if you're a bounty hunter, every day in \"Metal City\" can be Christmas--assuming you survive, since the worst of the Harbor's most wanted can fly, summon up tornadoes, or tear cars in half with their bare hands. But a skip's a skip, and manhunter Barb Wire is the best tracker in the business, and no super-gangster is too tough--as long as there's a fat price on his, her, or its head. Beautiful as she is lethal, Barb Wire really puts the \"drop dead\" in drop-dead gorgeous. Her boots may be made for walking, but they kick butt real pretty too.\n\n* Barb Wire Omnibus collects all the original Dark Horse Barb Wire tales, including the never-before-collected Ace of Spades series.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dark Horse", "name": "Barb Wire"}]}

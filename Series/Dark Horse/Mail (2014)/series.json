{"metadata": [{"year": "2014", "description": "Private detective Reiji Akiba has a theory about those awkward moments and weird coincidences we all encounter in life. They are actually encounters with the dead-their way of sending us a message. But you may not want to open such strange mail from beyond-not unless you can see the ghostly attachment, like Akiba can. And not unless you carry a gun that can kill what isn't alive, like Akiba's aptly named Kagutsuchi, \"the tool between God and earth\" . . . digging a divine grave to lay to rest the evil dead.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dark Horse", "name": "Mail"}]}

De:Tales is the duo's most personal work to date, presenting their work separately, together, and in tandemas the twins trade off on the roles of writing and illustrating, share those roles, or fly solo. Brimming with all the details of human life, their charming tales move from the urban reality of their home in S\u00e3o Paulo to the magical realism of their Latin American background.\n\nFeaturing a brand new cover, Moon and B\u00e1's seminal and soughtafter work is finally back in this handsome edition packaging, proving once again that they are a talented pair to watch out for.\n\n* Named by Booklist as one of the 10 best Graphic Novels of the year, Foreword Magazine gave it a silver medal on the Graphic Novel category of their \"Book of the Year\" award, and it was nominated for an Eisner Award.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dark Horse", "name": "De: Tales - Stories from Urban Brazil"}]}

But the dream that Chief Cutter and his Wolfriders fought and died for, the Palace of the High Ones, may be the very thing destroying them. The skills that helped them survive the harsh world are fading, and there is a growing threat from a tyrant obsessed with exterminating all elves--creating a disastrous brew that must surely boil over. \n\nVolume 1 collects Wendy and Richard Pini's sixty-page special and the first six issues of The Final Quest, the newest adventures of the Wolfriders!\n\n\"Even with a bit of a slowdown in pace, Wendy and Richard Pini's \"Elfquest: The Final Quest\" is a pleasant read. And with the setup for what's to come next time, I'm looking forward to seeing them in \"\"60,\"\" as the old issues' letter-column liked to state things. I suspect readers who made it this far will agree.\" - Comic Book Resources \n\n\"Elfquest is just one of those stories that you never want to end.

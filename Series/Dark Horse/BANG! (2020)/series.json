A best-of-the-best secret agent with memories he couldn't possibly possess, a mystery writer in her 60s who spends her retirement solving crimes, a man of action with mysterious drugs that keep him ahead of a constant string of targeted disasters, a seemingly omnipotent terrorist organization that might be behind it all . . .

A mind-bending story that ties in with past Kindt works (Revolver). Action, mystery, and altered reality!\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dark Horse", "name": "BANG!"}]}

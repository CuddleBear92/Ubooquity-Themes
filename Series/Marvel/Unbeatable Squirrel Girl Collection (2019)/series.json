Together with her best (human) pal Nancy and her best (squirrel) pal Tippy-Toe, and armed only with a tail and some fact-filled super-villain trading cards, she'll take on the likes of Kraven the Hunter, Whiplash and, oh, yeah, the Devourer of Worlds! Plus: Classic Squirrel Girl tales including her dazzling Ditko-drawn debut!\n", "name": "Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Collection"}]}

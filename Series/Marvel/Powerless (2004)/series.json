{"metadata": [{"publisher": "Marvel", "year": "2004", "type": "comicSeries", "description": "What makes a hero? Is it his actions, or is it the results of those actions? POWERLESS explores what it means to be a hero in very human terms. By re-imagining Marvel's most popular characters without superhuman powers, this series will strip down to the core heroes we have all come to know and love. These characters - including Peter Parker, Matt Murdock and Logan -- were fated to be heroes. Just because Peter Parker wasn't bitten by a radioactive spider doesn't mean he didn't do battle with a madman named Norman Osborn. Matt Murdock? Blinded, yes -- but with no heightened senses. However, he did become a legal champion of the poor in Hell's Kitchen, and he did cross paths with Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin. And Logan is, of course, the enigmatic -- and amnesiac -- drifter on the run from his past.\n", "name": "Powerless"}]}

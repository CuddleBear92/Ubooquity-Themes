Dazzler, debuted in her own series \u2014 one of the direct market\u2019s first exclusive offerings \u2014 and put audiences on their feet.

And as if that\u2019s not enough, Dazzler also pits her sound-based powers against Klaw, finds herself fighting for her life in prison and contends with every creep in the record business.\n", "name": "Dazzler"}]}

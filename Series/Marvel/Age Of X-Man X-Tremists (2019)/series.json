A perfect world doesn\u2019t just\u2026happen. It needs to be cultivated. That\u2019s where the X-Tremists come in. Psylocke, Iceman, Northstar, Blob, Jubilee and Moneta protect people from threats they won\u2019t ever even know existed, including the most insidious threat of all: love! But even as Department X continues its work of purging and revising the ill-fitting elements of society, an encounter with a pregnant rebel begins eating away at the team from within! Worse still, can two members of the squad resist falling prey to the very thing they\u2019re fighting to prevent? Some X-Tremists want to know love. Some X-Tremists want to know freedom. But some X-Tremists just want to watch the world burn.\n", "name": "Age Of X-Man: X-Tremists"}]}

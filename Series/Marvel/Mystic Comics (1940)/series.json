And now, for the first time in 70 years, the Marvel Masterworks bring the last of that trio of titles-Mystic Comics!

Meet comics' first super-stretching hero-Flexo the Rubber Robot; the hero from beyond the grave-the Blue Blaze; the Dynamic Man, Master Mind Excello, the invisible Dr. Gade, Dakor the Magician, Zara of the Jungle, the Space Rangers, Hercules, the devil-possessed Black Widow, and more!\n", "name": "Mystic Comics"}]}

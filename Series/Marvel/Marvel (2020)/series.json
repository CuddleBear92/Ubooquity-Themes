{"metadata": [{"publisher": "Marvel", "year": "2020", "type": "comicSeries", "description": "Thirty years ago, Alex Ross had a vision of a new series showing the Marvel heroes in a way they\u2019d never been seen before. The first realization of that idea became the blockbuster MARVELS \u2014 but today Alex finally brings about his original vision: An anthology of stories by unique, exceptional talents, many of whom are doing Marvel characters for the very first time. Over this showcase series you\u2019ll see work by such artists as Adam Hughes, Bill Sienkiewicz, Dan Brereton and more, linked together by an overarching story by Alex and Steve Darnall. This inaugural issue kicks it all off with superstar artists Frank Espinosa (Rocketo, Looney Tunes) telling an unusual Spider-Man story and Steve Rude (Nexus), teaming up with Kurt Busiek (MARVELS, AVENGERS) for an Avengers story, framed by Alex and Steve Darnall (Uncle Sam, Marvels) presenting a tale of the dread dreamland Nightmare, and his threat to the entire Marvel Universe\u2026and possibly beyond. A once-in-a-lifetime assemblage of talent \u2014 you won\u2019t want to miss a single page!\n", "name": "Marvel"}]}

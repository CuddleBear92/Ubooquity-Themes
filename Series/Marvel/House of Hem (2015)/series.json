{"metadata": [{"publisher": "Marvel", "year": "2015", "type": "comicSeries", "description": "For over thirty years, cartoonist Fred Hembeck has been poking fun at Marvel's mightiest heroes. Now, some of his greatest works are collected in a giant-sized one-shot that's bursting with belly laughs! Fred relentlessly roasts the Fantastic Four with the help of an all-star cast of artists! Fred wipes out the Marvel Universe in the tale they said couldn't be published (and almost wasn't)! Even Spider-Man and the Hulk are no match for Hembeck's trademark wit! Plus, a cornucopia of side-splitting short strips from the pages of Marvel Age, and an all-new introduction by the man himself!", "name": "House of Hem"}]}

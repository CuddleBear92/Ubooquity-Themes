But is he friend or foe!?

It's Jamie's choice that may well decide whether X-Factor stays together or cracks apart. Plus: in another corner of the X-Men universe, the Civil War really hits home! What happens when Cable and Deadpool find themselves on opposite sides of the fence, and both refuse to budge? What else: They fight! But it's not just your usual fun super-hero teeth-chipping spittle-snarling battle. It will change the lives of these two characters forever!", "name": "Civil War: X-Men Universe"}]}

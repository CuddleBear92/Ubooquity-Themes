And this comic wasn't your typical assortment of super-powered, straight-laced do-gooders. This was something completely new. The Human Torch, the creation of Dr. Phineas Horton, was neither man nor hero. He was a fiery force of nature who shocked and unsettled mankind. The half-human/half-Atlantean Sub-Mariner ventured from his undersea kingdom not with a mind set on peace, but bent toward vengeance! They're flanked by an eclectic set born out of the energy and imagination of the Golden Age - including the heroic Angel, robot invention Electro, hard-edged detective the Ferret, cowboy Masked Raider and jungle adventurer Ka-Zar.\n", "name": "Marvel Mystery Comics"}]}

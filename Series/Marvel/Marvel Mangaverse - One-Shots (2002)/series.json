{"metadata": [{"publisher": "Marvel", "year": "2002", "type": "comicSeries", "description": "Welcome to a world unlike any you\u2019ve seen before. A world populated with wild reinterpretations of your favorite Marvel characters \u2013 but a world also starved for energy. So desperate is the need that an Energy Well is built on Stark Island that will tap into an unlimited source in the Negative Zone! There is only one scientist that can tap into that source \u2013 a scientist named Bruce Banner! In this bookend issue, we introduce a cadre of characters that readers will see as brand new but also with a hint of nostalgia. Expect lots of cool stuff, such as: Hydra is teamed up with Namor to conquer the world! Dr. Strange is a Victorian doctor with Tigra as his sidekick! Ant-Man is a rock star/super scientist! The Wasp is a brilliant inventor and occasional tease to Bruce! Iron Man is now Iron Girl! And the Hulk is a 20-stories-tall monster bent on destruction! Sound different? Sound exciting? You betcha, True Believer!\n", "name": "Marvel Mangaverse - One-Shots"}]}

No longer a man, but a mockery of a man, an amalgam of reanimated flesh and computer circuitry, military strategist Col. Luther Manning has been locked in a state of living death. Stripped of his family, his humanity, but not his will, Manning has become the cyborg, Deathlok the Demolisher-a weapon of war programmed solely for destruction. A challenging blend of science fiction and psychological war journal, Deathlok set the pace for anti-heroes in the turbulent post-Watergate '70s. Illustrated by Rich Buckler and co-written by Doug Moench and Bill Mantlo, Deathlok's feature in ASTONISHING TALES forged a new path and pushed the moral relevance of Marvel Comics into a bold, and often frightening, new future. It's the complete Deathlok saga, culminating in a classic cross-time adventure with Captain America!\n", "name": "Deathlok Masterworks"}]}

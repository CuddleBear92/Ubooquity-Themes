But her investigations -- and her clients -- are far more dangerous than those of an ordinary private eye's. Her work takes her into the darkest corners of society -- to those places and beings that most people don't even know exist into the Nightside. She moves in a world of warring factions of supernatural creatures that call themselves \"The Others.\" They appear to be human, but behind the facade lie thirsts, passions, and powers far beyond any normal human's. For you see, they've lived among us since before recorded history. Joining her is her partner Key \"Ape\" Largo, whose incredible intellect and heart are hidden in a massive body. Together, they stand between us and the forces of darkness that are concealed under the shade of night!\n", "name": "Nightside"}]}

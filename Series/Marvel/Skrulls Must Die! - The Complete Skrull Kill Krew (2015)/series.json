Good thing nobody ever slaughtered those cattle for beef, right? Uh-oh.

They may be dying, but they ain't going down alone!  The Skrull Kill Krew wages violent warfare on all pointy-eared, green aliens hiding on Earth! And when the Skrulls launch their Secret Invasion, the Krew's bloody mission becomes more important than ever -- but what happens when one of them starts to sympathize with their victims?", "name": "Skrulls Must Die! - The Complete Skrull Kill Krew"}]}

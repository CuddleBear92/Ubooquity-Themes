Attempting to stay one step ahead of his pursuers, the Super Soldier confronts several troubling questions: What should you do when you discover that the actions of those you are protecting fly in the face of everything you believe? What do you do when you're suddenly an icon of forgotten times, a symbol of ideals no longer revered? And if you're Captain America, how do you keep going - especially if a shield and a strong right cross can no longer save the day?\n", "name": "Captain America: Dead Men Running"}]}

Trouble in leopard-skin boots, a six thousand dollar suit, and with a killer smile. Indeed, with his movie-star looks, heightened senses, razor-sharp tongue and thirty million dollar inheritance, you'd think that Al Kravinoff would be living The Life. But in reality, he's running a family legacy that makes him the first of his bloodline not to be obsessed with the death and destruction of a certain Wall-Crawler. Where to funnel that excess energy? Kraven is about to dive in the great fountain of all dreams, and swim with its many sharks. And god help the sleazebag producers, self-absorbed movie stars and hired goons who get in his path. Hollywood has seen its fair share of players, but no one plays the game like Kraven. Kraven wants to make a movie. And what Kraven wants, Kraven gets.\n", "name": "Spider-Man: Get Kraven"}]}

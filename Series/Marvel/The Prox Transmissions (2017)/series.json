{"metadata": [{"publisher": "Marvel", "year": "2017", "type": "comicSeries", "description": "A secret transmission from the far reaches of the galaxy falls into the hands of SETI radio astronomer Dr. Stephen Browning. His world begins to unravel as he discovers the cryptic message includes information of advanced technology and a dire warning from the future. Seeking the aid of brilliant-yet-impetuous playboy, Dr. Aston Wise, the two set off on an epic journey to discover the meaning of the transmission, only to discover that they are pawns in a much bigger game.  Humanity hangs in the balance as powerful forces vie for control of the future, with only Wise and Browning to stop them.\n\nDustin Bates is the lead singer and founder of the multi-media, modern rock band Starset. Inspired by the likes of Nikola Tesla, Carl Sagan and Ray Kurzweil (AKA, The Father of Singularity) their albums Transmissions and Vessels, along with videos, websites, novels and one-of-a-kind live performances, were created as part of the over arching concept The Starset Society. Science and fiction collide, raising awareness of the sweeping \u2013 and potentially catastrophic \u2013 changes that science and technology are making in our world.\n\nWith over 350 shows logged to date and the recent release of Vessels, Bates and his helmeted-and-pressure-suited crew (bassist Ron DeChant, guitarist Brock Richards and drummer Adam Gilbert) have set themselves apart with their unique and genre-defying brand of cinematic rock.\n", "name": "The Prox Transmissions"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "The Infinitum are a future society of people and aliens displaced to our past. Nine works in The Paradox Bureau, an agency that police the temporal diaspora and prevent crimes before they happen. Special Investigator Nine is sent on assignment to the 1930s (to the very place and time he was originally recruited) and must avoid altering his own past while investigating a seemingly unpreventable murder. Nine uncoils a temporal conspiracy at the heart of a militant separatist movement. Why would an organization dedicated to preventing murder before it happens cover up a series of grisly killings? Nine, a time agent who is able to return from his own future to offer himself advice or armed back-up, must now rely on his memory of the past rather than help from the future to solve a series of murders that can't be prevented. Through the flash of rayguns and the half-light and fog of a future-tainted 1930s, Nine pursues a killer while he avoids fouling the investigations of his own multiple selves. To save his future and solve the crime Nine risks changing the one moment that gave his life purpose. Nine must decide if love is a force of nature or a force of habit. The one event he can't live without must be altered to save the people he cares for, making himself his own worst adversary. \"With enough time, you can fix anything.\" Infinitum is a 120-page lavishly illustrated graphic novel that breaks all the science fiction \"rules\" of time travel.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "ChiZine Publications", "name": "Infinitum"}]}

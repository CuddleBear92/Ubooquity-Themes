Next, in \"The Fungus Among Us,\" a boy's moldy tennis shoes turn into a nightmare for his family, while in \"Skinned Deep,\" a decrepit old woman longs for firmer flesh and finds it on the jogging path...literally; and a noir horror story entitled \"Private I\" concludes this can't-miss title!", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Asylum Press", "name": "Satan Gone Wild"}]}

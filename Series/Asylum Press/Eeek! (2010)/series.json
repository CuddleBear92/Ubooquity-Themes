Taking a pinch of black humor from EC comics and mixing it with the art stylings of House of Mystery and Warren Comics, EEEK! blends a heady broth that hits you like a burning incense stick to the retina. Jason Paulos delivers the goods with tales of revenge, zombies, vampires, ghouls and monsters. Each tale drawn in a different style reminiscent of the B&W horror mags of the 70's and 80's.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Asylum Press", "name": "Eeek!"}]}

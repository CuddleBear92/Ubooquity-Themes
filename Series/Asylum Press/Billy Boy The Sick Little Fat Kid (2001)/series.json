Done in a style of classic cartoons from the Fleischer and Warner Brothers studios, Billy Boy rendered in a very cinematic and 'cartoony' style. This issue: In \"Slingshot Madness,\" Billy gets into some trouble when he and Teddy shoot up Old Mrs. Pine's house with their brand new wrist rocket. In \"Swamp Jitters,\" Billy is on the run from a giant spindly insect. And finally, in \"Bad Charm Bill,\" our pudgy star gets caught up in the black arts... and it doesn't end with a smile!

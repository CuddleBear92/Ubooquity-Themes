{"metadata": [{"year": "2013", "description": "Fans of classic cartoons will love this new series by animators Gene McGuckin (Ren and Stimpy, Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends) and Frank Forte (Bob's Burgers, The Super Hero Squad Show). This delightfully animated comic introduces the large, drunken, obnoxius Cletus and, his brother, the skinny, stuttering, twitching Floyd. The crazed Cletus is constantly beating on the lanky Floyd, but eventually Floyd gets his revenge. The series will cronicle their adventures \"Down On The Farm\" and beyond. In \"Gone Fishin'\", Floyd is attempting to catch a goldfish in a goldfish bowl, but the insane Cletus takes over and shows him how it's done. The Cletus and Floyd show is a twisted cross between Laurel and Hardy, Ren and Stimpy and Foghorn Leghorn. PLUS-- special gallery section featuring concept art, character design and animation tests.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Asylum Press", "name": "The Cletus and Floyd Show"}]}

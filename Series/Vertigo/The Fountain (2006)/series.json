{"metadata": [{"type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Vertigo", "year": "2006", "description": "This fall, Darren Aronofsky - the acclaimed director behind such critically acclaimed films as Pi and Requiem for a Dream - releases The Fountain, his most ambitious movie yet. Now, in time for the film's greatly anticipated debut, is the softcover edition of last year's sought-after THE FOUNTAIN graphic novel, which earned artist Kent Williams (Blood: A Tale, Havok/Wolverine: Meltdown) an Eisner Award nomination for Best Painter. \n\nAn odyssey about one man's thousand-year struggle to save the woman he loves, The Fountain follows Thomas as he feverishly travels through three distinct eras: as a 16th century conquistador battling a fierce Mayan army, as a present-day scientist searching for a cure for his wife's mortal disease and as a future explorer seeking to uncover the secrets of a dying star.\n\nThe Fountain graphic novel is a sister-project to the film, which is released by Warner Bros. Pictures and Regency Enterprises and stars Tony-Award-winner Hugh Jackman (The Boy from Oz, X-Men) and Oscar-winner Rachel Weisz (The Constant Gardener, The Mummy). Using the same story as its seed but stretched instead upon the limitless canvas of the comics medium, the graphic novel provides an insider's accompaniment to the movie, providing perhaps the ultimate \"director's cut.\"\n", "name": "The Fountain"}]}

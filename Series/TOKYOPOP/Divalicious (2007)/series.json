{"metadata": [{"type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "TOKYOPOP", "year": "2007", "description": "Divalicious! follows teenage pop princess Tina Young in her endless pursuit of fame, aided by her hapless personal assistant, Shaquille. It\u2019s a coming-of-age story set in the stranger than fiction world of modern American music\u2014where glamour and fame can come overnight, but maturity often proves much more elusive. \n\nFor our heroine, Tina, it\u2019s all about overcoming the odds (think Lucille Ball meets Kelly Clarkson). She\u2019s up against the likes of the sleek and beautiful Bit Fencer and the shadowy, Machiavellian music corporation A Few Notes. However, not all of Tina\u2019s obstacles come from outside forces. Her own unbridled enthusiasm and leap-before-you-look attitude often land her in hot (albeit hilarious) water. \n\nTina is the lovable underdog, a girl from a decidedly unglamorous background, who\u2019s traded in her love of music for an all-encompassing quest for fame. Part of the joy of Divalicious! comes from following Tina\u2019s missteps as she stumbles down the road to both artistic and personal fulfillment. Throw into the mix over-top-personalities like Tina\u2019s \u201csometimes\u201d band mates The Rrrrestless, Tina\u2019s strategically placed \u201cboyfriend,\u201d Chad\u2014and possibly the biggest loose cannon of them all, Tina\u2019s self appointed #1 fan, Stephina\u2014and well, let\u2019s just say that hilarity most definitely ensues.", "name": "Divalicious"}]}

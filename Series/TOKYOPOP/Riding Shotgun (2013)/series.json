{"metadata": [{"type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "TOKYOPOP", "year": "2013", "description": "The gun industry has finally managed to justify the existence of firearms in  mainstream America... by making assassination legal. And of course there is an assassin's guild and guidelines and an assassin's etiquette that should be followed.  Now, Doyle and Abby don't really have a lot of respect for any of that, until  they find themselves broke, unable to land high paying kills, and beholden to  the National Assassins Committee to even stay in good favor with anyone. The last thing they need is for their first NAC hit to go wrong, but when it ends up being Doyle's ex-girlfriend, all hell breaks loose. This is an absurd look at an increasingly vicious society, but its also the touching tale of two people brought close together by gun violence.", "name": "Riding Shotgun"}]}

She's got a boyfriend, but suddenly she's not sure if he's really the one for her, and the events  of the con keep throwing her in Matt's path.   Matt's somewhat of a mystery, too.   He's always got those wacky sunglasses on, and he can't seem to decide if he wants to be nice to Christie or just be a sarcastic jerk.  Throw in an encounter with Lida Zeff, manga-ka extraordinaire, and Christie's  dealing with one surprise after another.  Of course, convention weekends tend to end all too quickly,  and what will happen when suddenly distance is added to all of the factors keeping Christie and Matt apart?", "name": "Dramacon"}]}

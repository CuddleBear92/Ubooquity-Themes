You\u2019re not here because you\u2019re smarter, faster or stronger than other kids. You\u2019re better than other kids because you\u2019re the child of a god and a mortal. As a demigod, you\u2019ll get the best education a child of Greek, Norse, Japanese or Egyptian divinity can receive. Here at our Los Angeles based campus, you\u2019ll study subjects ranging from Algebra to Mythstory under noted instructors such as Greece\u2019s oldest mortal, Tithonus, and Japan\u2019s mistress of combat, Ms. Hitomi Hachiman. And let\u2019s not forget our very own Fighting Chimeras--divine league basketball champions two years running. Keep at \u2018em, Coach Hercules! You may have heard prophecies or seen visions of a great doom looming over the school, but the End Of All Things is no excuse for tardiness and absences will go on your permanent record. The challenges at a school for demigods are great, but if anyone can face them it\u2019s the students of\u2026 Pantheon High!", "name": "Pantheon High"}]}

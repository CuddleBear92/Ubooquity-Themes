An unusually usual day-to-day story in the Deep South, set in the gothic, swampy southern town of Wet Moon, a place fraught with lousy love lives, teen angst, and shadowy rednecks.\n\nAnd the third is a sneak peek of Katie O'Neill's Princess Princess Ever After, available this September! Join Sadie and Amira, two very different princesses with very different strengths, on their journey to figure out what \"happily ever after\" really means--and how they can find it with each other.\n", "name": "Oni Press Pride Spectacular"}]}

Everyone has a phone, a tablet, a computer -- more screens than you can count. Even with a world of information at her fingertips, Erin can't figure out the secret to popularity at her clique-y junior high school. So when uber-popular Wendy asks for help cheating on a test, Erin jumps at the opportunity. This could be her big break! Unfortunately, she gets caught, and her parents ban her from all her devices. Suddenly, Erin Song is the only girl in the world who's not allowed to look at a screen.\n\nAnd that's when Erin notices something funny: small, furry aliens making humans disappear with a weird device Erin's never seen before. No one else notices them, though -- except Erin's grandmother and two old men who run the local library. They've discovered that the aliens are using screens to control the human race, tricking them into thinking they aren't really there -- and that anyone who's been abducted never existed. \n\nNow it's up to Erin and her grandmother to save the day! But without technology on their side, do they stand a chance?", "name": "Unplugged and Unpopular"}]}

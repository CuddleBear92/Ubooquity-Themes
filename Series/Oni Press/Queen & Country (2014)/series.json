It's certainly a world of questionable morals. For instance, is it better to assassinate a general in the Russian mafia, to take his life, rather than allow him to peddle more guns and drugs in underprivileged countries? Tara's bosses seem to think so. But the Russian mafia ask their own questions--once someone has taken the life of one of their officers, can they continue to let that person live? Greg Rucka peels back the lid on the traditional espionage story to reveal the nastiness inside, and Steve Rolston brings it to life with stunning clarity.\n\nQueen & Country, Vol. 1: Operation: Broken Ground also features chapter break art by Tim Sale and a special short story illustrated by Stan Sakai.\n", "name": "Queen & Country"}]}

Family ties are the earliest ties that bind, setting the tone for the paths we will take in our future. So what if your father is Dirk Hopeless and your mother Nikki Savage, a superstar couple from the days of punk rock? When you're born a rebel, what can you possibly do to make yourself stand apart? For Rat Hopeless-Savage, the answer is to leave home and start a new life somewhere, become a normal citizen with a nine-to-five job. It's going pretty well, too, until Dirk and Nikki are kidnapped, and suddenly the family Rat tried so hard to deny needs him more than ever. His siblings - sisters Arsenal and Zero, and brother Twitch - know the Rat of old is the only one who can find their parents, and they're determined to make him trade his white-washed existence for the leather jacket and spiked hair of his youth. What follows is a madcap race against the clock, and a hilarious look at what happens when alternative lifestyles become the norm.\n", "name": "Hopeless Savages"}]}

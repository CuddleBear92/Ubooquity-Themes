{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "Oor Wullie and The Broons are cheerful comic strips that have appeared every week in The Sunday Post newspaper since 1936. Both strips, with their mixture of wry humour, slapstick antics, and good natured family fun, all told in their native Scots tongue, have long-since achieved legendary status with Scots everywhere!\n\nOor Wullie - or 'Our William' for non-Scots-readers - is the wee laddie with the spiky hair, dungarees and world famous zinc bucket seat whose big imagination and bags of energy lead to many an adventure - or misadventure - in the streets of his hometown, Auchenshoogle.\n\nThe Broons - or Browns - are 'Scotland's Happy Family that keeps every family happy'. Maw and Paw Broon, their grown up children Hen, Daphne, Joe and Maggie, and younger children, Horace, the Twins, and the Bairn, are the tight knit family that live at number 10 Glebe Street, with wily old, young at heart, Granpaw Broon always close by.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "DC Thomson", "name": "The Broons and Oor Wullie"}]}

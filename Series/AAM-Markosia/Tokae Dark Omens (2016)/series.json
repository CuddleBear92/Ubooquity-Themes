{"metadata": [{"name": "Tokae: Dark Omens", "year": "2016", "description": "Young Native American boy Tokae is in a big hurry to be a man. But when he accompanies his father Fast Deer on a hunting trip, the 13-year-old Lakota Sioux's life changes forever. Soon, he will be pitted against a savage pack of wolves and an even greater danger - a rival tribe who have kidnapped his sister and plan to wage war upon the Sioux. Tokae quickly realises that to become a great warrior and just man, he must first learn patience, honour and respect for the nature around him. Can the Great Spirit guide this brave but reckless boy into manhood? Tokae is an all-ages action-adventure tale by writer/artist Beniamino Delvecchio. It is set more than 200 years in the past - a time when the North American continent was populated not by sprawling cities and many millions of people but by the tribes of the Great Plains Indians.

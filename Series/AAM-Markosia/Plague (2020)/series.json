That same night, we meet our hero, Robb Aubert, a fearful friar of the Jedburgh Forest who has lost his faith and fellow friars to the dreaded plague.  Driven by a mysterious note from the German Bishop of Hildesheim, Friar Robb is about to catch the last boat leaving the English Isles for the mainland when he crosses paths with an injured English Fairy \u2013 Danann Atreyu \u2013 a fey girl who has just lost her family to the infamous Black Cross, the Warbishop Jean De Moray.  But Moray is more than just a bloodthirsty tyrant, he's a man haunted by the long-ago death of this baby brother and at war with himself over all he's done in the name of God since.  His dreaded Dyrewolves track Danann's blood-trail to the gates of the abbey where Friar Robb has unwittingly taken her in.  It seems Robb is harboring a magical creature \u2013 a crime punishable by death. ", "publisher": "AAM-Markosia", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

A city of the dead.\nCole, Sean, Alderman, Turner, Nash, Dalton: six professional criminals who, at a security depot on the outskirts of Chicago, pull off the biggest cash robbery in US history. Afterwards, they know the drill: keep a low profile. Keep your mouth shut. Be smart.\nBut they're about to find out that the old rules don't apply anymore. Not in a city where the dead are returning to life and feeding on the living. And not when one of them decides his share of the payoff isn't enough and that instead he wants it all.\nThese career criminals are wanted men. Dangerous men. And now they're going to have to work very hard to not become dead men.\n", "publisher": "AAM-Markosia", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

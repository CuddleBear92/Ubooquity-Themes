The goofy people and brilliant humor of this single-panel strip have put smiles on the faces of readers. This kooky collection, Close to Home Exposed, captures the hilarity of some of its best cartoon panels. As the comic's name suggests, Close to Home provides humor that's comfortable and familiar; yet the strip also has a palpable element of danger or nonsense. Topics vary widely, from health care and parenting to car repairs and shopping. But whether it's addressing dating or death--or just as likely, dating and death--Close to Home always delivers the off-center laughs its readers have come to expect.\n\n\"Close to Home is always a scream, and I love the goofy people that you draw. Truth is, I work with a lot of these folks.\" --Tom D.\n\n\"Where do you come up with these comics'! They are totally stupendous and are a big part of my stupid and nauseating life. You're the best!\" --Sleepless in New York\n\n\"Every day you make me laugh!! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!\" --An Online Fan\n", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

Faithful readers count on their cartoon heroine to tell it like it is, whether the subject's relationships, shopping, or parental responsibilities.\n\nIn Shoes: Chocolate for the Feet, women immediately comprehend this connection between two of Cathy's downfalls-food and shopping. Cathy continues to battle the bulge, constantly losing the tug-of-war between her thin clothes and a well-stocked refrigerator. Millions of women have hilariously identified with Cathy's struggles with the four basic guilt groups: food, love, mother, and career.\n", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

{"metadata": [{"name": "La Cucaracha", "year": "2013", "description": "129-Pages! \n\nAn anthropomorphic hipster cockroach is on the cutting-edge of American comic-strip humor. La Cucaracha (aka Cuco Rocha) and his pals voice the concerns and observations of the Latino-American community with an edgy, insightful wit.\n\nThrough La Cucaracha, creator Lalo Alcaraz makes blunt social commentary both hard-hitting and hilarious. The result is not just a pleasure, but also a craving.\n\nThe strong undercurrent of modern Latino themes and issues adds a sharp layer of meaning to the humor. In one strip, an immigrant bartender has listened to two customers rant, \"I'm telling ya, there's too many immigrants pouring into this country.\" When one of the customers asks for another drink the bartender declares, \"I'm an immigrant, and guess what? I'm not pouring!\"\n\nThis first of perceptive La Cucaracha humor will delight and gratify all audiences that appreciate intelligent, progressive, deeply amusing comics.\n", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

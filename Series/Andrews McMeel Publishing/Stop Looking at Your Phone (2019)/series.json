{"metadata": [{"name": "Stop Looking at Your Phone", "year": "2019", "description": "In his wonderfully deadpan instruction manual for our increasingly device-focused lives, illustrator Son of Alan taps into the strange truth of our obsession with the tiny screen. Revealing how ludicrous we've all become, and what wonders lie in stall for us mere inches from our faces, this book will make you want to reclaim your life, your friends, and your family from the tyranny of the backlit screen. Without nagging or preaching, this book uses hilarious but simple illustrations to highlight our universal (and ridiculous) dependence on the cell phone. In Stop Looking at Your Phone, device-driven readers will receive a much needed reminder of the possibilities life offers beyond the digitally enhanced screen.\u00a0", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

{"metadata": [{"name": "Non Sequitur", "year": "2013", "description": "254-Pages! \n\nIf a cartoonist successfully captures life's humorous and ironic moments in three short panels, readers applaud. When Wiley does the same in his single-scene format, they roll on the carpet laughing.\n\nNon Sequitur not only breaks the three-panel mold, it succeeds without regular characters, standard settings, or repeat situations to fall back on. Each piece, in other words, hangs out there as Wiley's snapshot of the worlds of work, leisure, and life's many crossroads.\n\nNon Sequitur's Beastly Things, as guided by Rolf the dog, keeps readers howling, growling, and scratching for more. You will delight, for instance, in crocodiles luring fishermen with dollar bills, Randy the science lab kid who announces that his homework ate his dog, and the desert dweller who celebrates the change of season by raking needles beneath his cacti.\n", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

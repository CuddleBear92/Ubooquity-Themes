{"metadata": [{"name": "Ziggy", "year": "2013", "description": "\"Ziggy must be part of me, because he feels as if he's been with me all my life.\" --Tom Wilson\n\nNo matter where you are, no matter what's going on in your life, Ziggy has been there. For the past 35 years, readers around the world have picked up newspapers, opened greeting card envelopes, or caught sight of T-shirts and there's Ziggy, unfailingly showing how to appreciate life and find the silver lining in any cloud. \n\nTom Wilson's character--an admirable mix of Ben Franklin, Dale Carnegie, and Forrest Gump all rolled into a little bald icon--strikes a chord in everyone. And that's why so many will cherish A Little Character Goes a Long Way, a celebration of Ziggy himself. After all, it's the character of this character that's earned Ziggy such a special place in our hearts.\n\nThis treasury includes many classic Ziggy frames and strips, each highlighting the traits that make Ziggy the upbeat, hopeful, and unflappable optimist that he is. There's Ziggy generally making molehills and wrinkles out of life's highest mountains and lowest valleys; Ziggy and his menagerie of pets; and Ziggy taking the time to appreciate nature's beauty at its best. This little Everyperson reminds us all of what's really important, and this treasury will undoubtedly do the same.\n", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

{"metadata": [{"name": "It's All Absolutely Fine", "year": "2017", "description": "It's All Absolutely Fine is an honest and unapologetic account of day-to-day life as a groaning, crying, laughing sentient potato being for whom things are often absolutely not fine. Through simple, humorous drawings and a few short narratives, the book encompasses everything from mood disorders, anxiety, and issues with body image through to existential conversations with dogs and some unusually articulate birds.\n\nWith each chapter a particular set of struggles is picked up, looked at, and squished about a bit using visuals before being put down again with a little more resolve.  Problems related to mental health that can be very devastating and even isolating are discussed openly in a way people are often told not to, but this is as much a book about the human emotional experience that touches all of us as it is about mental health. Through the drawings, the reader is shown that it is okay to struggle, and that it is okay to talk about struggling, to not undermine oneself by yelling 'it's fine' when it isn't, and while all this is going on to know that it is absolutely possible to hold on to hope, and of course humor. \n\nBuilding on Rubyetc's huge online presence, It's All Absolutely Fine includes mostly new material, both written and illustrated, and is inspirational, empowering, and entertaining. Hope and tenacity abound in this book that is as heartening as it is hilarious.\n", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

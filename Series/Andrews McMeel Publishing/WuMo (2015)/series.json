{"metadata": [{"name": "WuMo", "year": "2015", "description": "\"\nThe cartoon WuMo celebrates life's absurdity and bittersweet ironies, holding up a funhouse mirror to our modern world and those who live in it. Thanks to its delightful artwork and irreverent humor, this hilarious comic by writer Mikael Wulff and illustrator Anders Morgenthaler has grown from an underground sensation to one of the biggest and most popular strips in Europe.WuMo's inventiveness is reminiscent of their countryman Hans Christian Andersen--if Andersen's fairy tales had been populated by sadistic pandas, disgruntled office workers, crazy beavers, Albert Einstein, Snoop Dogg, and Darth Vader.\n\nNamed WuMo, after the Danish duo's last names, it appears in the largest papers in northern Europe, including Germany's Die Welt, Denmark's Politiken, and Norway's Dagbladet.", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

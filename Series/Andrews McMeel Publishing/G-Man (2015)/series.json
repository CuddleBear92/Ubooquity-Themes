{"metadata": [{"name": "G-Man", "year": "2015", "description": "When Michael G (yes, \"G\" is his whole last name, and that's why everyone calls him G-Man) has to keep a journal in Mrs. Rosario's class at school, naturally he writes about his ambition to have superpowers and join the superheroes of his city (like Captain Thunderman) in the fight for justice.  After all, his friend Billy Demon just got an awesome winged flying suit and superpowers of his own, and now he's the most popular kid in school!  Mikey would just love to have superpowers too, but how will he get them? And if he does get them, what will he do with them?\n \"G-Man is funny! Really, really funny! You know how hard it is to make a funny comic? Believe me, plenty hard! I should probably encourage you to buy a copy, but honestly, I don't need the competition.\"  -Jimmy Gownley, author of Amelia Rules\n \"Giarrusso has a kid-friendly sarcastic wit which will resonate with readers ages 8 and up.\"  -Snow Wildsmith, School Library Journal\n \"G-Man, Chris Giarrusso's awesome all-ages superhero series, is one of the most fun and exciting new properties to come down the pike in ages.\"  -John Hogan, Graphic Novel Reporter\n", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

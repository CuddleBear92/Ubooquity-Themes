{"metadata": [{"name": "The Slanted Life of Emily Dickinson", "year": "2017", "description": "Emily Dickinson said: \"Tell all the truth, but tell it slant.\" Artist Rosanna Bruno does just as the poet asked in a series of several dozen witty, hand-drawn cartoons inspired by what we know--and don't know--about Dickinson's life and work. The Slanted Life of Emily Dickinson explores--often hilariously, and always respectfully--the myth surrounding the reclusive poet using her own words to skew, or slant, a story that is already somewhat fuzzy in detail.\n \n\nBeginning with a line or two from Dickinson's poems or letters, Rosanna Bruno presents an image of a real or imagined event. For example, she imagines Dickinson's Facebook page (\"Relationship Status: It's Complicated\"), her OkCupid dating profile (\"I am small, like the wren; and my hair is bold, like the chestnut burr...\"), her senior yearbook page (\"Girl Most Likely to Talk to Birds\"), and several other hilarious scenes and fictional artifacts. The result is a wickedly funny portrait of one of the most beloved (and mythologized) poets in the American canon.\n", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

{"metadata": [{"name": "Cat vs Human", "year": "2013", "description": "In this collection from popular Web comic Yasmine Surovec, fabled characters and fairy princesses are replaced with cat ladies and gents ... and cats.  Rapunzel's prince comes to rescue...his cats. Sleeping Beauty's true love's first kiss comes not from a prince but from a curious kitty. Each comic puts a contemporary witty spin on classic stories while continuing Yasmine's brilliant comedic take on cats and their owners.  The result is a collection that illustrates that cat ladies make for more interesting (and somewhat crazy) princesses.\n", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

{"metadata": [{"name": "The Other Coast", "year": "2013", "description": "What would road rage in Beverly Hills look like? From the whimsical perspective of The Other Coast creator Adrian Raeside, it would involve a prim-and-proper hurling of a jar of Grey Poupon at the offending driver. The Other Coast: Road Rage in Beverly Hills is the first collection of Adrian Raeside's strip featuring his off-kilter view of contemporary life. Raeside's lighthearted look at culture, politics, fashion, society, and life in general is both insightful and hilarious. Whether it's taking a clever poke at our obsession with wireless phones, our inability to maintain a workout program, or the witty banter of married life, The Other Coast is a bastion of original thinking, wry wit, and out-loud laughs. Much of the humor comes at the expense of Toulose, the eccentric screenwriter, and his cause-seeking wife, Vicki. But the strip also features a colorful cast of repair people, kids, contractors, tech-support goons, agents, pets, and much more. Those enjoying strips that provide more than the \"same ol' schtick\" are sure to relish a visit to The Other Coast, where folks aren't deep enough to be shallow.\n", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

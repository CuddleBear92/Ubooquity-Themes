Here, familiar faces from the works of E. B. White, Rudyard Kipling, Beatrix Potter, and additional folk and fairy tales take on the role of unlikely heroes fighting to save their world.\n\nThe year is 1951, and there's a dark tension in the air. Heroes of legend, some thought only to exist in fairytales, must battle against an evil that threatens the world. Vix Reynard, a wily woman with a proud history of impulsive, daredevil deeds, is given the choice of a lifetime to join the League of Extraordinary Vermin. Her choice may decide the fate of the world, not to mention the League itself.", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

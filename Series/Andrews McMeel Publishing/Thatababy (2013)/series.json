{"metadata": [{"name": "Thatababy", "year": "2013", "description": "Thatababy's philosophy can be summed up quite neatly: To keep his parents on their toes. This new comic strip stars - well, a baby, of course, and the mother and father in charge of raising him. Thatababy's premise is as fun and instantly accessible as its crisp, colorful art: It's a baby's job to drive parent's crazy. You may recognize Thatababy as a finalist and runner-up in the Amazon Comic Strip Superstar contest that ran on Amazon.com in the fall of 2009. Thatababy received glowing reviews from the contest's celebrity panel of judges.", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

{"metadata": [{"name": "Starring Sonya Devereaux", "year": "2016", "description": "No budget is too low, no dialog too cheesy, and no plotline too thin to keep Sonya from appearing in these straight to DVD flicks. From horror - to action - to erotic thriller, each issue is a laugh-filled send up of a different genre and movie \u2013 but they all have one thing in common: Sonya Devereaux and FUN! Okay, that\u2019s two things. But just like gravy on mashed potatoes is delicious, Sonya in a crappy movie is hilarious!  Now showing:  THE NAKED ARE THE DAMNED 2: Satan has possessed a greedy CEO that wants the farm land owned by Camille\u2019s (Sonya Devereaux) family. With the help of a voodoo queen, Camille must use her wits, charm, and skill to defeat a zombie army!", "publisher": "American Mythology Productions", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

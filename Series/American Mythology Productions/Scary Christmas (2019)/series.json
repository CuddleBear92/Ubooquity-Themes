{"metadata": [{"name": "Scary Christmas", "year": "2019", "description": "The most wonderful time of the year will resound with shrieks of fright, and those shrieks will be YOURS! The pages of Scary Christmas are chock-full of fear, as we explore traditional, international yuletide tales of murder, mayhem, and monsters! From the Alpines comes Frau Perchta, with a penchant for disembowelment. From France, meet Hans Trapp, the cannibal disguised as a scarecrow. And from Iceland, welcome J lak\u00f6tturinn, the \"yule cat\" that will devour you whole. Fans of classic EC Comics horror will love Scary Christmas, which delivers three dark tales of terror with twist endings, illustrated by three different, international artists, and all designed to give your chills the chills. But be warned: These tales are NOT for children, and contain graphic violence, gore, and nudity, and are for mature readers only!\n", "publisher": "American Mythology Productions", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

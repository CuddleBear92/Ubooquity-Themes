We don't like to brag, but this is one of the most ridiculous things you'll see all year, with a cast that's absolutely nuts. Filbert and his reluctant pals Hazel and Cashew find themselves the toast of the town after miraculously winning their middle school science fair competition, but the town itself is about to become toast when the swirling, yowling Meowstorm roars into the city of Turtleview.

You WON'T find another comic that's as ludicrous as this. Trust us.\u00a0", "publisher": "American Mythology Productions", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

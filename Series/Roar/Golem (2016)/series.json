In a world where no one has the time to try something that isn't already provided by the system, Steno fears that his dreams will one day die.  He has no idea that the fate of the world relies on his ability to dream.\n\nSet in a future, post-Eurozone Italy, entrenched in a culture of hyper-capitalism, GOLEM follows young Steno Critone as he is kidnapped during a political protest gone sour.  Taken in by the band of labeled \"terrorists,\" he learns that things are not as they seem in society, and that he has the power to not only change the city, but reality itself. \n\nThis intensely imaginative political-sci-fi graphic novel is a visual tour de force, created by contemporary design icon Lorenzo Ceccotti, better known as LRNZ, whose design-influenced illustration provides a lush, fluid backdrop of maga-like dynamism with the cinematic scope of western comics, creating a style that is wholly unique and absolutely breathtaking.", "name": "Golem"}]}

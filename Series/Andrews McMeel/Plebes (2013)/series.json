{"metadata": [{"name": "Plebes", "year": "2013", "description": "150-Pages!\n\nScott describes Plebes as silly, stupid, and in-your-face -- just like the college boys it lampoons. This first-ever compendium of the most popular strip from The Onion is a hilarious assult on the moronic, vulgar behavior often exhibited by beer-swilling, girl-ogling college males. The strip's mocking self-help themes offer \"guidance\" on topics ranging from \"Turning Your Dormitory Into A Lucrative Real Estate Investment\" to \"Turn Your Beer-Commercial Fantasy Into Reality.\" Students and grads everywhere will enjoy the irreverent, sometimes controversial humor in Plebes, a strip that more than one college newspaper editor has been fired for running.\n", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

{"metadata": [{"name": "Prickly City", "year": "2013", "description": "A small town in the American Southwest... everything in the desert is designed to prick you, wound you or eat you. What better metaphor for 21st century Earth? Prickly City is a comic strip about the friendship between Winslow, a coyote pup, and Carmen, a straight and narrow kind of kid. Prickly City offers a conservative perspective on political and social events within an ongoing storyline. As Carmen might say, \"We may not be correct but we will always be right.\" Their high jinks provide endless laughs as Winslow gets into trouble and Carmen follows. Join Carmen and Winslow for their adventures in the desert! In the e-book original Fifty Shades of Politics, Winslow runs for president and skewers the whole electoral process along the way.\n", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

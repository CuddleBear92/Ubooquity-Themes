{"metadata": [{"name": "Real Life Adventures", "year": "2013", "description": "Dogs, bosses, garden slugs, who sits next to who at Thanksgiving, cheating at golf, fretting the night away, carping couples on long trips, eating over the sink, toenail clippings, cosmic order, hairballs, flop sweat, coughing into one's elbow, clogged pipes, clogged arteries, parking crooked at the mall.\nThat's what real life is all about. And that's what Real Life Adventures is all about.\nFor nearly two decades, Lance Aldrich and Gary Wise have drawn, and drawn from, the everyday stuff that we all slog through.\nAnd on any given day, they like to think their little square slice of life is a nice change from the rickety roller coaster the rest of the world seems to be.", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

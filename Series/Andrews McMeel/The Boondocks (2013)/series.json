{"metadata": [{"name": "The Boondocks", "year": "2013", "description": "The Boondocks took the syndication world by storm. The notoriety landed Boondocks creator Aaron McGruder in publications ranging from Time magazine to People magazine which named him one of the \"25 Most Intriguing People of '99. Centered around the experiences of two young African-American boys, Huey and Riley, who move from inner-city Chicago to the suburbs (or the \"boondocks\" to them), the strip fuses hip-hop sensibilities with Japanese anime-style drawings and a candid discussion of race. Funny yet revealing, the combination of superb art and envelope-pushing content provides one of the most unique strips ever.\n", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

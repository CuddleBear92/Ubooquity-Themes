Almost eight years and 2000 cartoons later, Savage Chickens is now a popular website with millions of readers. Savage still draws every cartoon on yellow sticky notes, and his cartoons cover an eclectic range of topics, including: work, psychology, arachnophobia, pop culture, cats, time travel, love, zombies, and more.\n", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

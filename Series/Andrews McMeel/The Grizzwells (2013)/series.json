{"metadata": [{"name": "The Grizzwells", "year": "2013", "description": "For a family strip with bite, you can't do better than The Grizzwells by Bill Schorr. Syndicated since 1987, the strip features a four-bear family of grizzlies. In creating The Grizzwells, Schorr wanted to do a simple family-oriented strip: \"Since human characters dominate most of my editorial cartoons, I didn't want to draw them in my strip as well. My younger daughter has been collecting bears forever and she thought bears would be perfect subject matter.\"", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

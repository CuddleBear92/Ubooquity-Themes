{"metadata": [{"name": "Rubes", "year": "2013", "description": "In his comic strip, Rubes, cartoonist and \"sit-down\" comedian Leigh Rubin takes a careful look at everyday situations and human nature--and then pokes fun at them. The result is a hilarious and often uncannily accurate exploration of our crazy life and times.\n\nFeaturing favorite Rubes cartoons handpicked by Rubin himself, The Wild and Twisted World of Rubes is a best-of collection that serves as a wonderful introduction to the comic strip People magazine calls \"sneakily funny.\"\n\nSyndicated internationally by Creators Syndicate, Rubes is one of the most popular single-panel cartoons in the country. Rubes appears daily in more than 400 newspapers and is also featured each week as \"Rubes Friday Funnies\" on the long-running, nationally broadcast program AgDay. Leigh's blog, Tales from a Twisted Mind, is a consistent favorite on AgWeb and draws in tens of thousands of readers each month. Rubes is also featured in calendars as well as on T-shirts and greeting cards.\n", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

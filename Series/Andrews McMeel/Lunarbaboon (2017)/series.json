{"metadata": [{"name": "Lunarbaboon", "year": "2017", "description": "Lunarbaboon shares life's parenting moments from the perspective of a 30-something dad/husband/chaos survivor. Together with the savvy, laid back Mom, wild child Moishe, baby Matilda, and a former Julliard student (their cat), Lunarbaboon must navigate the family and social dynamics of everyday life. Ranging from the hilarious (defeating closet monsters with a \"stun\" blaster that offers surprising facts about bears, Mars, and cats) to the sweet (the gray scale-to color transition out of depression at the touch of a loved one), this collection explores the bonds within a family and all the characters who bring both order and chaos to life.Lunarbaboon's perfect meld of crabby humor and moments of impactful honesty give these comics a wide range and distinctive voice that's both comical and sincere.", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

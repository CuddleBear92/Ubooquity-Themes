{"metadata": [{"name": "Ink Pen", "year": "2013", "description": "129-Pages! \n\nInk Pen never runs out of insights into the seedy underbelly of cartoon character employment. Dunlap has a truly unique perspective and storytelling style about the odd world of cartooning. \n\nFrom the very first frame, Ink Pen invites us to encounter the struggles of Hamhock, the talking pig who tries to make his big break into the biz. But it's a ruthless one that sees him only as a side of the other white meat. We quickly learn that rejection only makes us stronger... or slightly more stupid. Read and laugh as Hamhock and an array of plucky sidekicks are thrust into danger by careless superheroes and the villains they duel.\n", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

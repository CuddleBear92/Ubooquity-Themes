{"metadata": [{"name": "Man v. Liver", "year": "2013", "description": "Meet Man: He's witty, carefree, and probably not sober. He's Dean Martin meets Jack Benny, Don Draper, and Jack Donaghy.  He imparts upon readers his clever, unabashed musings of romance, party culture, and bachelorhood. The life of the party, the collected contemplations in Man v. Liver will amuse and inform aspiring connoisseurs of class.\n \nIn Man v. Liver, Man expels his alcohol-fueled wisdom to all who yearn to encapsulate themselves in a life of forgotten nights and fine tailored suits--which, as he will tell you, are handy to sleep in if you wish to be the best dressed at breakfast.\n \nMan v. Liver is a collection of witty musings accompanied by their creator: a roughly sketched, style-conscious bachelor who's never short on quips aimed at fellow party guests, dates, and, of course, his beloved liver.", "publisher": "Andrews McMeel", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

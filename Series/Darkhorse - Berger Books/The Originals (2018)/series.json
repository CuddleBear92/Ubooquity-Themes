Includes 32 pages of never-before-seen development art, process pieces, and behind the scenes extras--all annotated by Gibbons.\n\nIn a retro-futuristic city of industrial gray where hover scooters, music and drugs rule the street, THE ORIGINALS are the toughest, most stylish gang around. For two childhood friends, nothing is more important than being one of them. But being part of the crowd will bring its own deadly consequences.\n\n\"The Originals is Dave Gibbons doing what he was born to do: telling a story that's all his own, and telling it with grace, verve and drama. The result is, well...original! Topnotch comics.\"--Frank Miller\n\n\"Sharp as the lapels on his mohair, revved up on Lambrettas and doobs, THE ORIGINALS is Dave Gibbons at the very top of his considerable game, dripping style and soul like dance floor sweat, delivering a narrative that's young, good-looking and up for a ruck. Buy this immediately, and smell the oil, the blood, the seaside... I don't care where you've been; you ain't been nowhere 'til you've been in.\" - Alan Moore\n\n\"What a fantastic looking book...Dave's vast storytelling experience and effortless ease with the medium shine from every page of THE ORIGINALS.\"--Garth Ennis\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Berger Books", "name": "The Originals"}]}

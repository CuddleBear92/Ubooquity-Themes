King Arthur is dead. His death has resulted in chaos once again engulfing Bretunia. Queen Morgana is determined to wrest the kingdom from the reigning monarch and has marshaled the Dragonarmies to devastate the land. Without Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table, the Dark Queen's minions are unstoppable. The destiny of Camelot rests with a mismatched band of adventurers -- an apprentice wizard, a galanic-healer, a mage-knight of Makidos and the heir apparent, Knight Aubriet. The fabled Armor of Light holds the key to restoring the balance of power. Will Castle Camelot crumble under the might of Queen Morgana, or is deliverance at hand? \n\nCreated and written by Lady Antiva.\n\n\"A refreshing and entertaining take on storytelling without taking itself over seriously.

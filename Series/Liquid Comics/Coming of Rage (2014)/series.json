Just that. What was the punch line? Who cares -- I just liked the sound of it. My imagination went crazy thinking about what could happen when three such impossibly different characters were thrown together. I'd never seen anything like it, and I wanted to know their story. So, it had to be written. I met with comic book legend Steve Niles, (30 Days of Night). We hit it off, and decided to beat out the story of a very special young man's coming of age, and the two unlikely friends who helped him to survive it. After a bit of hard, fun work, a five issue series of comic books was born, telling not only the story of how these three ended up on the run together, but how the central character, Ritchie, lost his innocence and became one of the most powerful vampires in the world. And the title would be COMING OF RAGE.\" - WES CRAVEN", "name": "Coming of Rage"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2005", "description": " What if a group of college freshmen suddenly got amazing superpowers? What if the powers were based on exactly what they were thinking at the moment? You'd get the Intoxicator, who burps at his foes to make them drunk. Or Quaker, the Amish kid who created earthquakes with his belly. You'd get a kid who can talk to plants-and is stalked by the plant who loves him. You'd get a fearless leader who desperately wants superpowers, but is left out of the bonanza. Co-created by Austin Powers and Buffy star Seth Green and written by newcomer Hugh Sterbakov, Freshmen is an uproarious combination of superpowers and college...with a talking beaver!

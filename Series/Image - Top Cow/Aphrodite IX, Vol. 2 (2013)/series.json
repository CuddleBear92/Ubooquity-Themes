{"metadata": [{"year": "2013", "description": "Aphrodite IX returns for Free Comic Book Day!  This first free issue launches a new ongoing series of Top Cow's fan favorite, memory challenged, green haired, questionably human heroine.  Hundreds of years after a cataclysmic event scorched the surface, Earth and its inhabitants have been forever altered and a new landscape and political struggle has taken hold with three distinct factions fighting for control.  Aphrodite IX is both anachronism and advanced technology in a world that she no longer recognizes.  No aliens, just humans and their genetically and technologically altered descendants in a mixture of the best Sci-Fi and Fantasy has to offer!", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Image - Top Cow", "name": "Aphrodite IX, Vol. 2"}]}

In a country called 'Unshak,' there is a group of people who can use the powers of the stars for divination and fortune-telling. When Tan-Shi was a child, he wished he could have a crystal ball just like his father, but when Tan-shi was eight, his parents left him -- leaving nothing behind but the crystal ball. Tan-shi and his sister Miyabi were taken in by their uncle. Several years later, Miyabi finds an egg of a very rare bird, but instead of leaving it as it is, she takes it home with her to care for it. Since that day, ten years have passed. Tan-shi is now much older, but the adventure on planet Omega has only just begun!", "name": "Astrological Story (Media Do)"}]}

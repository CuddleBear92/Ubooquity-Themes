The stranger, seemingly tall enough to reach the Heaven's, outstretched his hand and offered to take Sasahara to a very, very far away place. A place across the ocean that was illuminated only by the light of the moon and the stars; a place that was far away from her life and far away from Shimizu, the young boy to whom she felt she had done something terrible. What happens when, along the path to this far away place, she encounters Shimizu? A Nightwalk Faraway is an endearing tale of frailty, strength, and the courage to face our fears.", "name": "Night Walk Faraway"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2018", "description": "Yarrow is a young chef determined to make her mark on the cutting edge of cookery with her insect-based creations. Though her enthusiasm is infectious, it rubs some of her fellow cooks the wrong way, especially Chanda Flores, Yarrow's personal hero and executive chef of an exciting new restaurant. Her people have been eating bugs for centuries, and she's deeply suspicious of this newbie's attempt to turn her traditions into the next foodie trend. While Chanda and her scrappy team of talented devotees struggle to open on time, Yarrow must win over Chanda\u2014and Milani, the neighbor she's been crushing on for weeks\u2014or lose this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to achieve her dreams. Co-written with chef and food writer Soleil Ho, Blue Delliquanti's sweet coming-of-age story takes us deep into a world of art, mystery, and memory on the culinary frontier.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Iron Circus Comics", "name": "Meal"}]}

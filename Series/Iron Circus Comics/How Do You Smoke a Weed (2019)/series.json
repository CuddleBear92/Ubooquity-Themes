But she stumbles on her first obstacle right away: she has no idea what she's doing! A trio of helpful (and more mature) sequoias give her a dried cannabis flower and send her on a delightful journey of discovery. The forest is alive with wizened old animals who know the laws and customs, the history and science, and all the ins and outs of America's increasingly legal pastime. How Do You Smoke a Weed? is both a fun storybook quest and a practical how-to for the novice weed smoker! With marijuana decriminalized or legalized in 26 states and Washington, DC, dispensaries popping up everywhere, and experienced users openly rejoicing, it can be hard for the marijuana newbie, cowed by years of Just-Say-No disinformation, to find your way. Written by experienced, conscientious users and presented in an easy-to-read comic book format, How Do You Smoke a Weed? fills that gap. Perfect for the cannabis-curious, and with new insights for the veteran smoker.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Iron Circus Comics", "name": "How Do You Smoke a Weed?"}]}

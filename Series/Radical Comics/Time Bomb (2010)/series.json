A group of international scientists and archeologists on a publicly funded dig discover a hidden city beneath the streets of Berlin. Constructed as a failsafe option for the Nazi party should they lose the war, the city is also home to Hitler's ultimate doomsday weapon - an Omega bomb designed to wipe out the human race - and it's just been activated. Now, crews of scientists with state-of-the-art weapons and equipment must travel back in time to stop the bomb from going off. However, they soon discover that, rather than going back in time for 24 hours as intended, they've been sent back 65 years into the heart of Hitler's Germany.", "name": "Time Bomb"}]}

But no one was prepared for the shocking after-effects of the experiment, as thousands of portals to a dimension of pure terror flooded across the planet, doorways to a world of hideous evil! Now, the woman whose incredible wealth funded the scientific facility will fight until her dying breath to close the \"Pandora's Box\" which has been opened, but this time, she won't do it alone. Pandora is back, but to fight the horror she has unleashed upon mankind, she'll have to adopt the long-forgotten persona of the War Goddess, as she and the sultry woman-spider, Widow, take on the menace of the all-new Hellina in the opening salvo of a war which will ravage the earth.

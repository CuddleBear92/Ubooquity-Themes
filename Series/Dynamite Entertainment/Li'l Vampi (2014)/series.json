{"metadata": [{"year": "2014", "description": "Welcome to Stoker, Maine, the most normal, boring town in the world. Or is it? There are sea serpents roaming the docks, a mummy in the town hall. And a gaggle of ghouls and goblins just devoured the breakfast cereal aisle at the local Shop-O-Mart. Who is behind this monstrous rampage? And can it be stopped? When there are spooks afoot and arcane mysteries to be solved, it's time for Vampirella-teen scourge of the supernatural-to crack the case! And if that isn't enough, each Li'l book comes with a two-page activity sheet and a \"Pantha\" comic strip by Brandon and Orion Jerwa and Agnes Garbowska!", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dynamite Entertainment", "name": "Li'l Vampi"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2016", "description": "Dr. Herbert West, The Reanimator, returns! Setting up shop in New Orleans, the brilliant Dr. West continues his life's work: the revival of the dead by purely chemical means. To accomplish this task, he recruits Susan Greene, a young and wide-eyed pharmacologist fascinated by his macabre experiments. Initially unfazed by West's unorthodox practices (including how he funds his research - by selling zombie brain fluid as a narcotic), Susan may regret her scientific curiosity as sinister forces - those aligned with Elder Gods and Haitian Voodoo - begin to align against the Reanimator! Dynamite Entertainment proudly resurrects The Reanimator, H.P Lovecraft's notorious mad scientist, in a fear-fraught four-issue miniseries! Take what you love best about the television shows \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Walking Dead\", throw in Cthulhu tentacle terror and backwater Louisianan superstition, and you have the all-new horror comic hit!", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dynamite Entertainment", "name": "Reanimator"}]}

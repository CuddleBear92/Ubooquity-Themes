Snow has XP-xeroderma pigmentosum-a very rare genetic affliction that forces him to avoid light at all costs, and will likely give him cancer later in life. His parents died under mysterious circumstances and he's now being stalked by the shadowy characters who want Snow to stop trying to find out how they died--or else they'll bump off his remaining loved ones.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dynamite Entertainment", "name": "Dean Koontz's Fear Nothing, Vol. 1"}]}

Now, for the first time ever, fans can experience the entire collection of fantastically controversial cover art from series artist and co-creator Darick Robertson.

Topped off with a bonus Afterward by producer Adam McKay (Anchorman, Talladega Nights), the definitive collection of covers fans have been clamoring for has officially arrived - all in one glorious hardcover! Creator Commentary from Darick Robertson: \"What's really fun about this book, in my opinion, is to watch the covers unfold like a story in and of itself. I hope that's what you'll get out of it. Ennis had a great imagination for covers and I always looked forward to what he'd suggest next. In the beginning, I was coming up with numerous sketches and ideas to present, but as we went on, the covers became a real collaboration and he always had a good idea. Some of these sketches (sometimes it would take more than one) are presented here so you can see the evolution of the process. Revisiting the world of The Boys by creating a new cover for this project only seemed appropriate, like spending time with some not-so-friendly old friends.\"\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dynamite Entertainment", "name": "The Art of The Boys: The Complete Covers by Darick Robertson"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2016", "description": "Spinning out of the epochal events of KIRBY: GENESIS comes the saga of Sigurd Dragonsbane, the greatest champion in all Valhalla. Since time immemorial tales of his adventures have resounded throughout the halls of gods and men alike. But what happens when Sigurd and his colleagues-wise Balduur, rakish Honir, and caustic Heimdall-discover that Valhalla isn't the only mythic realm?...And that all the others are now conjoined into one vast magical landscape? Why, they set out to explore it, of course-and to rescue a princess beset by dragons. But all isn't as it seems in these newly unified Mythlands, and Sigurd's latest exploit could be his last! Based on character concepts and designs by Jack Kirby, DRAGONSBANE draws back the curtain on the astonishing mythical underpinnings of the Kirby universe.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dynamite Entertainment", "name": "Kirby: Genesis - Dragonsbane"}]}

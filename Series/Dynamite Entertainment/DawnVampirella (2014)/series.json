{"metadata": [{"year": "2014", "description": "Our story begins when the silver tongued demon Masodik tricks and kidnaps both Dawn and Vampirella. He tells them that they are the 2 most beautiful women in all of the worlds, these two 'Bad Girls'. Their demon host demands a cat fight to see who is best suited to his purposes, but the ladies suggest something more feminine -- a storytelling contest. Together they take us to the bloody shores of Draculon, to post-apocalyptic New York and to worlds beyond imagination. Only Ravana knows what rewards and punishment await the winner and the loser in this duel of horror hostesses. Written and drawn by Dawn creator Joseph Michael Linsner!\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dynamite Entertainment", "name": "Dawn/Vampirella"}]}

These latter, having now become genuine war lords, call on the services of a mercenary and weapons corporation, having survived the invasion and capable of providing men, weapons and ammunition, or even essential products: Blackfire Industries. \nIt is in this environment of chaos and war that we discover the Chaos Team, a mercenary unit linked to Blackfire and led by John Clem, on a protection mission in Granada, for the new Pope.\n", "publisher": "Akileos English", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

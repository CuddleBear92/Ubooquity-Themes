In exchange, he has the ability to use the powers of any animal by biting its bones. When Mana meets Shotaro on her travels, she expects nothing but trouble from the childish, ignorant boy-until he takes off into the sky like a bird. Mana may be impressed, but dokeshi are viewed as freaks by most of the population. And with the governor missing, all dokeshi are under suspicion. Ever-opitimistic Shotaro refuses to be discouraged and journeys on with Mana in the name of Justice!", "name": "B. Ichi"}]}

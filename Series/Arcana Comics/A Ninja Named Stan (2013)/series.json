{"metadata": [{"year": "2013", "description": "Stan Kidderick, Ninja P.I. is not really a ninja at all. And in fact, he's not even a very good private investigator. He can't actually use the sword he carries around and he only wears a ninja mask, which he never takes off. He seems quite strange, but he's just a man who coped with having everything he loved in life taken away from him, by convincing himself he was meant to fight crime as a ninja detective. Yes he's lonely, and yes he's only hiding from the pain of his former life. But he's busy working whatever cases he can get using his true calling and talent in life, computers.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Arcana Comics", "name": "A Ninja Named Stan"}]}

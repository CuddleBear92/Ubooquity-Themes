{"metadata": [{"type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Zenith Press", "year": "2015", "description": "A graphic novel by a lifelong motorcycle club member, inspired by the secrets of one percenters.\n\nPhil Cross has been a Hells Angel for over 40 years. In the world of outlaw motorcycle clubs, there are many stories that can't be told, for a variety of reasons, but they have spurred Phil's imagination to create a fictional story inspired by real events.\n\nOne-percenter antiheroes populate these pages - tougher and wilder than any character ever played by Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda, or Marlon Brando. The guys in the tales Phil spins might remind you of Easy Rider and The Wild One, but the hard glint in their eyes proves that they are based on the real deal.\n\nIllustrator Ronn Sutton provides stunning visuals to bring Phil's stories to life. These bikers aren't going to ride off into the sunset any time soon.", "name": "Lucifer's Sword MC - Life and Death in an Outlaw Motorcycle Club"}]}

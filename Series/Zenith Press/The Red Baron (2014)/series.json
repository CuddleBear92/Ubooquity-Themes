Vansant beautifully depicts the fearsome intelligence and mid-flight awareness that would earn Richthofen 80 air combat victories-from his rough beginnings, to the years he spent commanding Jasta 11 from the cockpit of his fabled red plane, to his eventual leadership of the infamous \"Flying Circus,\" named for the group's colorful aircraft and mobile airfields. World War I's most notorious flying ace died young under controversial circumstances, but the Red Baron's legend and tactical acumen lived on far long after his death and helped usher in a new type of warfare that would reign supreme twenty-five years later: war in the air.\n", "name": "The Red Baron"}]}

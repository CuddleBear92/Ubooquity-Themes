She's pushing 40, a borderline burnout, the ghastly memories of her last investigation still clinging like shadows. McGregor is younger, more dedicated, hanging onto some measure of idealism whatever the world might throw at him.\n\nWhen two fellow agents go missing inside a Long Beach warehouse, Shaw and McGregor are sent to investi-gate. But what they find waiting is far from routine, as the local police have already discovered to their cost. Before the night is out, our heroes will encounter terror beyond their most appalling nightmares\u2014in a place where the night may never end at all.\n\nA new kind of horror story for modern America, written by Garth Ennis (Preacher, The Boys, Crossed) and drawn by Goran Sud\u017euka (Y: The Last Man, Hellblazer)", "publisher": "AfterShock Comics", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

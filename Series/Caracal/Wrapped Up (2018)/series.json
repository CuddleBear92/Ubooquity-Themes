{"metadata": [{"year": "2018", "description": "Milo is just your average twelve-year-old kid. He lives next-door to an ex-con wizard. He's got a sad single dad, a stepdad who is basically Indiana Jones, and a Goth stepsister. And he's the only \"normal\" person in a wacky, crazy world in which the hits just keep on coming. Evil (but super cute) cats? Check. A babysitter who's younger than him and also an incompetent witch? Check. Chocolate cows grazing in his living room? That too. Milo would really love to be left alone to skateboard and eat pizza, his two main life goals, but circumstances are constantly, hilariously, absurdly against him.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Caracal", "name": "Wrapped Up"}]}

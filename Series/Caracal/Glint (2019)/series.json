Or a gorgeously drawn and high-energy, other-world adventure. Your pick! But if I wanted a kid to ask critical questions about why the world isn't as it should be, and who is benefiting and who is being hurt, without hitting them over the head with it, I might slip them this book.\"  \u2014Thi Bui, author of The Best We Could Do, illustrator of A Different Pond \"The world of Glint pulls you right in and never lets up for a moment. A thoughtful, layered world, with grit and grace.\"  --Harvey Award winner Mariah McCourt, creator of Stitched and New York Times bestselling writer of True Blood: All Together Now  \"Sattin and McGinty's Glint is a masterful work of rebellion, filled with rousing speeches, edge-of-your-seat adventure, treachery, and danger. It dares to ask the question: how much is hope worth to you?\" --David Gallaher, Harvey Award-winning writer of The Only Living Girl, The Only Living Boy, High Moon, and Box 13 \"A sweeping sci-fi adventure, rich with imagination and mystery.\" -Ben Costa, creator of Rickety Stitch and Pang the Wandering Shaolin Monk \"Reading Glint is like watching a Saturday morning cartoon rerun from a show you forgot existed. Sattin's fun dialogue bounces effortlessly from McGinty's dynamic illustrations which are brought to life by Kays' warm, inviting colors. Rarely is there such harmony between creators. Glint is something special.\" -S.M. Vidaurri, creator of Iscariot and Iron: Or the War After  ", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Caracal", "name": "Glint"}]}

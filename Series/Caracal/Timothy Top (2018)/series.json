{"metadata": [{"year": "2018", "description": "Timothy Top is a grade school kid going through a hard time. His parents are constantly quarreling, and he's feeling like an outsider among his classmates. His fascination with nature and superheroes makes for an unusual combination that few of his peers can relate to. But when a crooked businessman moves into the neighborhood with plans to \"reinvent the local park\" into a concrete monstrosity devoid of nature and life, Timothy sets out on a mission to save a famous tree from the bulldozers. Being just a kid, he doesn't know how he'll be able to go about this, until one night he discovers that he's been given the power of a magical green thumb that can heal and grow plant life! He's a superhero! But will he be able to use this power to save the park or the relationship between his parents? A simple tale but with many layers, this first volume supports respect for the environment, as well as dealing with bullies, quarreling parents, and school expectations. Future volumes tiptoe into other topics such as discrimination, forgiveness, and commitment.  ", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Caracal", "name": "Timothy Top"}]}

{"metadata": [{"type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Papercutz", "year": "2016", "description": "From comics master Peyo (The Smurfs, Benny Breakiron) comes Pussycat--a lovable, mischievous tuxedo cat who spends his time chasing after milk and snacks and framing other members of his family for his shenanigans. This cat isn't exactly the noble hunting type-- he'd rather play a game of kickball with the resident mouse than chase after him-- and most of the humor originates from his clever, yet often foolish ways of trying to get what he wants (e.g. milk and snacks). Originally published in Spirou magazine in France, this is a delightful collection of comics that can be enjoyed by all-ages.\n", "name": "Pussycat"}]}

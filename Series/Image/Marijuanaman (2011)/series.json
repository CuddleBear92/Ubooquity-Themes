It's pretty much a straight-out, color-saturated, action-packed, mind-altering, insanely kinetic tour de force of pure awesomeness... You can stare at these pages forever, just basking in the unadulterated pop-art beauty of them.\" -Comics Bulletin\n \n\"Marijuanaman has woven a complex tapestry of musical references and deep plot lines that have been said should impress both comic geeks and Bob Marley      aficionados.\" -Zippycart.com\n\n\" Jim Mahfood's slick and retro-feeling style is just beyond gorgeous.

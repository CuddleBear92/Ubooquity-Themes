{"metadata": [{"year": "2019", "description": "Something hunts people on the outskirts of town... Sam and Lielet are two new friends living in Ethiopia. They're dealing with the kind of problems that all kids have: judgmental social cliques, condescending adults, alienation... and a legendary brain-eating monster straight out of folklore. Sure, it's not going to be easy, but all they have to do is live through it.

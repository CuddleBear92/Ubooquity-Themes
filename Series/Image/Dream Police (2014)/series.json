They've seen it all. But when Frank steps away and disappears...and the woman who returns says she's Joe's partner, that she's always been Joe's partner...he begins a journey into the unknown that will shake the dreaming down to its very foundations.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Image", "name": "Dream Police"}]}

Chronicling the rise of Homo-Geneticus, a genetically altered Breed of humanity, designed to survive an impending apocalypse, which spawns both the heroic Silver Star and the sadistic Darius Drumm!

It's a huge, sweeping epic, filled with classic Kirby trademarks: crackling energy, memorable characters, outrageous dialogue, explosive action and ham-fisted romance!", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Image", "name": "Jack Kirby's Silver Star"}]}

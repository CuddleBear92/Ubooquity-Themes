{"metadata": [{"year": "2012", "description": "86 volts. That's all this little powerhouse needs to spring to life. 86 volts of pure energy to perk her up and wake the dead. Who is 86 Volts? Where does she come from? What does she want? These questions lead to shocking answers, but don't tell 86, because she knows even less than you do. She awakes in a world of dreams from some previous unknown adventure that left her lifeless upon a gravestone awaiting a bolt of lightning to bring her back to life.\n\nWhat will happen when little 86 throws down and mixes it up against a witch and her evil fetus? When black science and white magic clash in a spiritual free-for-all, the only result is pure chaos.\n\nTeaming up once again following their novel QUIXOTE, writer BRYAN J.L. GLASS and artist MICHAEL AVON OEMING have concocted one super-charged little fairy tale that leaves no one standing following its no-holds-barred, knock-down, drag-out brawl of the living dead. This 56-page one-shot is chock full of action, poetry, darkness and redemption. What more could you ask for?\n\nMake sure your batteries are fully charged (and your dead are properly buried) before reading this issue of utter mayhem and fun.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Image", "name": "86 Voltz"}]}

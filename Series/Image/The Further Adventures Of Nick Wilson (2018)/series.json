Packing on an extra 20 pounds and peering through a medicinal marijuana haze, he is trying to build a future when all that's left is just a man who hasn't been super for a very long time.\n\nThese are THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF NICK WILSON.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Image", "name": "The Further Adventures Of Nick Wilson"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2011", "description": "The groundbreaking 3-time Eisner Award-winning graphic novel, now available digitally for the first time! Join us as we explore this missing piece of Jim Henson's career in a celebration of his creative process, gorgeously brought to life by acclaimed illustrator Ramon K. Perez (Wolverine and the X-Men, Spider Man: Year One). Discovered in the Archives of The Jim Henson Company, Tale of Sand is an original graphic novel adaptation of an unproduced, feature-length screenplay written by Jim Henson and his frequent writing partner, Jerry Juhl. Tale of Sand follows scruffy everyman, Mac, who wakes up in an unfamiliar town, and is chased across the desert of the American Southwest by all manners of man and beast of unimaginable proportions. Produced with the complete blessing of Henson co-CEO Lisa Henson, Tale of Sand was hailed as a groundbreaking achievement upon release, winning the Eisner Awards for Best Graphic Album, Best Penciller/Inker, and Best Production Design, as well as winning the Harvey Awards for Best Graphic Novel and Best Artist.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "BOOM! - Archaia", "name": "Jim Henson's A Tale of Sand"}]}

Before Sarah braved the Labyrinth to save her brother, another young woman sought to save a young boy named Jareth from the clutches of the Goblins.

This is the untold history of the Goblin King.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "BOOM! - Archaia", "name": "Jim Henson's Labyrinth: Coronation"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "WHY WE LOVE IT: In the footsteps of Archaia titles Rust, Iron, Will o' the Wisp, and The Reason for Dragons, debut writer-artist Jorge Corona brings a brand-new voice to the comics industry with Feathers. With our passion for working with fresh talent, we could not be happier to introduce his work to a wider audience. \n\nWHY YOU'LL LOVE IT: There's never been a better time for fantastic, all-ages comics that embrace both the darkness and beauty in life. Fans of Avatar: Legend of Korra, Mike Mignola, and Amulet will fall in love with Poe, the boy covered in feathers. \n\nWHAT IT'S ABOUT: A recluse boy born covered in feathers must help his first-ever friend, a young girl named Bianca, as she tries to return to her home beyond the slums of the Maze. They must dodge street gangs and child-snatchers along the way, and perhaps together will learn the secrets to his mysterious past.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "BOOM! - Archaia", "name": "Feathers"}]}

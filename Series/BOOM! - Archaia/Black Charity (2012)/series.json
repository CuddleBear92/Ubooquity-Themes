{"metadata": [{"year": "2012", "description": "A dark, cynical thriller set in the urban UK. When Charlie moves into his new flat, he meets a colorful array of new characters, including a dominatrix and a skinhead yabo, witnesses a murder, and finds himself on the run from assassins and fixers sent by the highest levels of government. Shades of Howard Chaykin's Black Kiss and the hard-boiled style of 100 Bullets, all with a very British (as in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels British) accent.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "BOOM! - Archaia", "name": "Black Charity"}]}

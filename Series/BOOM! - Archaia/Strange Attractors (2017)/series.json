Enter Heller Wilson, a brilliant mathematics student, who discovers that his ailing, perhaps insane, mentor has been saving New York City from societal collapse by a series of \"adjustments,\" a la the Butterfly Effect. But now, all signs point toward an impending disaster. Can Wilson take what little he's learned and save the city in time?", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "BOOM! - Archaia", "name": "Strange Attractors"}]}

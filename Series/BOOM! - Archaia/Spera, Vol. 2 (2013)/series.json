{"metadata": [{"year": "2013", "description": "In this sequel to the critically acclaimed first volume of Spera, exiled princesses Pira and Lono travel to the bustling city of Kotequog to avoid the clutches of Pira's mother, the Evil Queen. Obtaining jobs as adventurers, the two best friends set out on a series of quests that land them in perhaps more excitement than they'd bargained for. Told in four chapters and a series of stand-alone shorts, each drawn by a different rising talent in comics, Spera: Volume 2 brings the same gorgeous artistry as its debut installment. The series, based off the original webcomic experiment, brings artists together from around the globe to showcase their talents as some of the premier fantasy artists in the industry. Spera will appeal to art lovers and children of all ages, especially fans of The Legend of Korra, Patricia Wrede's Dealing with Dragons, Disney's Tangled, and the Flight series.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "BOOM! - Archaia", "name": "Spera, Vol. 2"}]}

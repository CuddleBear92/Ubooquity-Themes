{"metadata": [{"year": "2019", "description": "After years of difficulty trying to have children, a young couple finally announce their pregnancy, only to have the most joyous day of their lives replaced with one of unexpected heartbreak. Their relationship is put to the test as they forge ahead, working together to rebuild themselves amidst the churning tumult of devastating loss, and ultimately facing the soul-crushing reality that they may never conceive a child of their own. Based on author Ingrid Chabbert's own experience, coupled with soft, sometimes dreamlike illustrations by Carole Maurel (Luisa: Now and Then), Waves is a deeply moving story that poignantly captures a woman's exploration of her pain in order to rediscover hope.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "BOOM! - Archaia", "name": "Waves"}]}

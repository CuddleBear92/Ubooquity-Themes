{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "\"What's to Love: Asaf Hanuka, in a very short period of time, has become one of comics' most critically acclaimed and sought-after creators. His autobiographical webcomic, The Realist, began winning awards shortly after its launch, including a Gold Medal from The Society of Illustrators. \n\nWhat It Is: Acclaimed Israeli cartoonist Asaf Hanuka's weekly strips unfold an emotional autobiography full of humor and melancholy, wild imagination, and quiet desperation. Collected for the first time in English and including never-before-collected strips, The Realist delivers both honesty and whimsy from a master of his craft. With echoes of R. Crumb and Daniel Clowes, Hanuka moves readers with his depictions of everyday life, commenting on everything from marriage to technology to social activism through intimate moments of triumph and failure. \"", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "BOOM! - Archaia", "name": "The Realist"}]}

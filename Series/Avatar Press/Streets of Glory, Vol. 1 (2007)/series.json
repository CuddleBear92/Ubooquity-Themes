{"metadata": [{"year": "2007", "description": "Garth Ennis re-defines the Western with this sweeping six issue epic. Joe Dunn is one of the last bastions of the old guard drifters, those men that could be trusted to defend the common man with integrity, honor, and if need be, hot steel of death. Dunn has been away from Montana for more than 15 years, lost to all who knew him. Now he comes riding into a small town, Dunn still representing the best of the past, an era quickly fading. But it is 1899, the way things are done is changing, the future is coming. But before he is done making things right, the bodies will pile up while the streets run red with glorious blood. Ennis teams with Mike Wolfer for this epic full color series that promises to thrill every fan of Garth's powerful story-telling and brutal violence.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Avatar", "name": "Streets of Glory, Vol. 1"}]}

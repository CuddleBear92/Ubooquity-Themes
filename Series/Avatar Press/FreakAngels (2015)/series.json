{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "Warren Ellis' hugely popular web comic, Freakangels, is here, collected in this gorgeous, full-color series! Twenty-three years ago, twelve strange children were born in England at exactly the same moment. Six years later, the world ended. This is the story of what happened next. So welcome to Whitechapel, some years from now, just barely above ground in a flooded England, where a clan of eleven strange people with purple eyes - the Freakangels - have carved out some sort of a life for themselves. A life that starts to show big cracks when a girl called Alice from Manchester turns up with a shotgun and a grievance, having met the lost, prodigal last Freakangel, who had very different ideas about what they should do with themselves and this flooded future England. Because the Freakangels have a big secret: Something very bad is their fault.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Avatar", "name": "FreakAngels"}]}

{"metadata": [{"publisher": "Knockabout", "year": "2011", "type": "comicSeries", "description": "Winshluss' graphic novel is an adult noir movie that has elements of both comedy and tragedy. The narrative begins with a shooting, before flashing back to Pinocchio's creation (he is now a robot-like android) and adventures, echoing Collodi's original story, which was far darker than Disney's version. The artwork is primarily done in pen and ink and watercolour, but switches to paint for larger splash panels.", "name": "Pinocchio"}]}

It brings together the studies of magic and rebirth The Birth Caul and Snakes and Ladders, plus an interview with Alan Moore from Egomania. \n\nOriginally a performance piece by Alan Moore and Tim Perkins, The Birth Caul is a shamanism of childhood, a journey from the present to the past, back into the womb and beyond. The magical creation theory story of love, death and resurrection Snakes and Ladders was also a performance, entwining the disinterment of Oliver Cromwell and Elizabeth Siddall, the visionary nature of Arthur Machen's experiences after the death of his wife and Alan Moore's magical traveller John Constantine. In Eddie Campbell's self published magazine, Egomania, he interviewed Alan Moore at length to produce the most informative and fascinating insights into the creative process and Alan's study of magical realities.", "name": "A Disease of Language"}]}

{"metadata": [{"publisher": "Knockabout", "year": "2010", "type": "comicSeries", "description": "The Playwright enjoys a quiet moment in the local park where he can mentally sort his ideas and is often frequented by young ladies. Once he saw a pigeon defecate onto a businessman's shoulder; it struck him as absurd that such an event is considered lucky. Surely the luck lies with passers-by who, statistically, are far less likely to be similarly soiled at that precise moment. Similarly, the Playwright derived an almost perverse sense of relief upon receiving news that an old friend has developed prostate cancer. Statistically, he reasons, such news significantly reduces the chances of him being similarly afflicted. And to be honest, at his age, his prostate needs all the statistical support he can muster. The Playwright: a dark comedy about the sex life of a celibate middle-aged man. Co-Published by Top Shelf Productions and Knockabout.", "name": "The Playwright"}]}

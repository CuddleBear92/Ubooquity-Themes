At daybreak, amid the wreckage and flotsam on the beach, fishermen discover a survivor: a monkey dressed in full military regalia, the mascot of the shipwrecked French vessel. Now, the good people of Hartlepool despise all Frenchmen, though they have never seen one in the flesh. Nor have they ever seen a monkey. But this brutish, bestial castaway tallies with the vague impression they have of the enemy\u2026 this alone is enough for the ape to find himself court-martialled. \n\nInspired by the famous legend of the Hartlepool monkey, this is a tragi-comic fable of war and jingoism, of xenophobia and ignorance and of the glimmering of enlightenment...\n\n\u201cMoreau\u2019s artwork is splendid throughout, a perfect match for Lupano\u2019s changes from high drama to absurdist farce, from laugh out loud comedic silliness to the sad and tragic.\u201d \u2013 Forbidden Planet\"", "name": "Hartlepool Monkey"}]}

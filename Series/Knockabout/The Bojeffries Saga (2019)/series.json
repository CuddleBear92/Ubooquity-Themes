{"metadata": [{"publisher": "Knockabout", "year": "2019", "type": "comicSeries", "description": "\"Jobremus Bojeffries is like any other father -- trying to keep the peace in a house stuffed with two kids (Ginda and Reth), uncles Raoul and Festus, a baby and old Grandpa Podlasp. Never mind that one's a werewolf, one's a vampire, Grandpa is in the last stages of organic matter, and the baby puts off enough thermonuclear energy to power England and Wales...\n\nAll right, they're no ordinary family. And this is no ordinary book, with stories spanning decades, a whole chapter written as light opera, a Christmas episode, and an all-new 24-page comic bringing the Bojeffries up to the present day. On every page, the wry and anarchic creativity of the creators shines through: Alan Moore's affectionate and penetrating grasp of human nature (and British culture) creates a kind of desperate poignancy in the characters, brought to memorable life by Steve Parkhouse's deft and articulate line work.\n\nIt's all there, untutored, unpolished, ramshackle and always on the edge of collapse. Very much like Britain itself.\"", "name": "The Bojeffries Saga"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2014", "description": "Virgil Partch, tutor to the tanked, scholar of the sloshed, professor to the plastered, and endowed with a scholarship from the School of Advanced Study of Alcoholic Endeavor, flung himself into months-long research of the most arduous kind in order to produce \u2015 for our collective betterment \u2015 this report on the hangover, and how one may acquire it. At the height of his career, working in quiet obscurity, Partch pursued his goal quietly and selflessly, often confining himself for long hours without food or sleep in dim, ill-ventilated holes-in-the- walls, doggedly researching, testing, rejecting, seeking no reward but that elusive ideal mixture to satiate one's palate and wet one's whistle. The foamy formula of excess (C2H5OH + homo sapiens) has created a combustible concoction that has long fueled sleepless nights, great passions, artistic achievement, and regretful mornings, but never before has it produced such inspired hilarity. Collecting the top shelf of VIP's drink-themed artwork including well-known favorites, this new book is sure to delight even the most rigid teetotaler (and perhaps cause them to reconsider). So batten down the hooch and prepare to cast off on the stormy seas of booze with your faithful captain, Virgil Partch!", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Cork High and Bottle Deep"}]}

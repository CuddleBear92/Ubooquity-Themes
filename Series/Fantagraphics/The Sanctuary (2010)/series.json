{"metadata": [{"year": "2010", "description": "In Nate Neal's first full length graphic novel, the author explores the primal mysteries and sordid inner workings of a Paleolithic cave-dwelling tribe, creating an original \"silent\" reading experience by using symbols instead of words. When a mysterious nomad girl is offered up as an item of trade, she seeks refuge by forming a tenacious friendship with the local cave-painter turned outcast. Together they set out on a dangerous mission to bring truth to their corrupt tribe with the help of their new discovery (via some psychotropic mushrooms): drawings that tell a story. Subsequently, they become enmeshed in the violent power struggles and sensual intrigues between the alpha males and alpha females.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "The Sanctuary"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2019", "description": "Once a thriving working class neighborhood on Chicago\u2019s south side, the \u201cBottomyards\u201d is now the definition of urban blight. When an aspiring fashion designer named Darla and her image-obsessed friend, Cynthia, descend upon the neighborhood in search of cheap rent, they soon discover something far more seductive and sinister lurking behind the walls of their new home. Like a cross between Jordan Peele\u2019s\u00a0Get Out\u00a0and John Carpenter\u2019s\u00a0The Thing, Daniels and Passmore\u2019s\u00a0BTTM FDRS (pronounced \u201cbottomfeeders\u201d) offers a vision of horror that is gross and gory in all the right ways. At turns funny, scary, and thought provoking, it unflinchingly confronts the monsters\u2015both metaphoric and real\u2015that are displacing cultures in urban neighborhoods today.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "BTTM FDRS"}]}

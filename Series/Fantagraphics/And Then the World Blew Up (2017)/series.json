{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "This collection is an intellectual punch in the face to the new political order. What do you get when you cross a fistful of pens and an enormous stack of blank paper with somebody who resents the sweet-smelling muzzle of good manners and polite conversation, who delights in always saying the wrong thing at the right time in contempt of every expectation that the naked truth is at all obscene? This is a collection of cartoons, illustrations, personal essays, culture-war correspondence and interviews with famous intellectual and artistic outlaws, who, like the author, are just trying to defuse the apocalyptic bomb that is the miracle of our Creation. Drawn, painted, and collaged in Mr. Fish\u2019s many virtuosic styles, Naked Women is an eloquent take-no-prisoners response to American political life.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "And Then the World Blew Up"}]}

Also included: \"The Brain That Wouldn't Virginia Woolf,\" \"Tom Waits on the Moon,\" and \"So Long Mary Ann.\" \"When I read Jason for the first time, I was just as excited and devastated as the first time I read the poems of Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman. Jason's work is poetry.\" -- Sherman Alexie", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Athos In America"}]}

From the title creatures in \u201cNight of the Jibblers,\u201d to the witches and ogres of \u201cCockbone,\u201d to the Godzilla-sized, centaur-bodied depiction of the title character in \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d to the disarmingly cute yet terrifying demons of \u201cDemonwood,\u201d to the depraved, caped crusading antihero in \u201cMark of the Bat,\u201d Simmons is a master of creating terrifying beasties that inspire and inflict nightmarish horrors, usually taken to unforgettable extremes. The individual stories in The Furry Trap stand on their own as mini-masterpieces of skin-crawling terror, but collectively complement each other in a way that only heightens the anxiety and dread pouring from page to page.

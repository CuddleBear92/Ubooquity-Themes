{"metadata": [{"year": "2004", "description": "For more than two decades, Steve Brodner has been the most savage editorial cartoonist/illustrator to work in the United States. (Internationally, his only rival for acid-tipped outrage is England's Ralph Steadman.) And, unlike the handful of his American colleagues who share his go-for-the-jugular approach, Brodner is also a virtuoso draftsman, whose every line and splash of color is an exquisite treat for the eye. Freedom Fries is Brodner's absurdly nightmarish journey through the last 30 years of American politics. And what a cast of characters: Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, Bush II. And those are just the presidents! Add in such pretenders to the throne as Newt Gingrich, both Doles, Gore, and Nader, craven cabinet officers and legislators and you have the most horrifyingly hilarious rogues' gallery of striking resemblances anywhere.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Freedom Fries"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2019", "description": "Ambrose Bierce, a contemporary of Mark Twain's, is known for his irreverent wit, sharp sarcasm, and sardonic view of human nature. His perennial classic of American satire, The Devil's Dictionary, offers biting observations that lampoon people, politics, American society, and its most cherished institutions. Acclaimed New Yorker cartoonist Keith Bendis has chosen a sampling of Bierce's most wickedly funny definitions to bring to life through illustration. Bierce's acerbic wit has met its perfect match with Bendis's humorous, tongue-in-cheek watercolor drawings.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "The Devil's Dictionary"}]}

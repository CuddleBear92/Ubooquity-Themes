In addition to these three pin-up cartooning luminaries, other notable who contributed to the pages of the Humorama digests included longtime illustrator Jefferson Machamer; Basil Wolverton, who influenced a generation of underground cartoonists; Mad's Dave Berg (\"The Lighter Side\"); and future syndicated cartoonists George Crenshaw (\"Belvedere\"), Bill Hoest (\"The Lockhorns\") and Brad Anderson (\"Marmaduke\").", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "The Pin-Up Art of Humorama"}]}

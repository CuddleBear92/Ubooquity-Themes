{"metadata": [{"year": "2008", "description": "This multifaceted anthology collects over 25 stories from the first decade of Jason's career, including his remarkable calling card, the novella-length thriller \"Pocket Full of Rain,\" which has never before been published in English. Like a number of his initial stories, \"Pocket\" is actually drawn with realistic human beings instead of blank-faced animal characters - a true revelation for Jason fans. In fact, this book showcases three distinct styles: his earliest \"realistic\" drawing style  an intermediate \"bighead\" cartoony style that still features humans, and the \"funny-animal\" style for which he's now best known. The book reveals a young cartoonist experimenting with styles, working through his obsessions (love, loneliness, film, Hemingway) and paying tribute to his cartooning heroes (Wolverton, Moebius, Pratt). Also, croquet-playing nuns, sentient cacti, autobiographical drunken escapades, lists of people who deserve to die, and a color gallery featuring God cheating at Trivial Pursuit. \n\n\"This collection is all over the place but it's all Jason, and like all his work it's funny and deep and smart and I cannot get enough of it.\" - James Sturm, from his introduction ", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Pocket Full of Rain"}]}

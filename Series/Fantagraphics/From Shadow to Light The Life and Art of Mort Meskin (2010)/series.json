{"metadata": [{"year": "2010", "description": "From Shadow to Light: The Life and Art of Mort Meskin\u00a0is a coffee table art book and critical biography of one of the twentieth century\u2019s most influential comic book artists. Meskin\u2019s career spanned both the Golden and Silver ages of comics, from the 1940s to the 1960s. His drawing, chiaroscuro technique, and storytelling are considered by connoisseurs of the form to be among the most sophisticated of his time. His passion for his artwork was equaled by his skill, and the quality of his overall\u00a0oeuvre\u00a0blurs the artificial distinction between high and low art. Yet he is known mostly among hard-core aficionados today, eclipsed by many of his peers, some of whom he profoundly influenced. Among Meskin\u2019s fans and admirers are Jim Steranko, Joe Kubert, Alex Toth, Carmine Infantino, Steve Ditko, Jerry Robinson, and Jack Kirby.\u00a0From Shadow to Light: The Life and Art of Mort Meskin\u00a0will finally give this neglected artist the recognition he\u2019s due.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "From Shadow to Light: The Life and Art of Mort Meskin"}]}

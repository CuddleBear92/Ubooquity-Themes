{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "In\u00a0Ripple, Martin is a floundering painter desperately attempting to pursue his fine-art inclinations rather than toil in the world of commercial art. He hires a model, Tina, to pose for a series of paintings he dubs \u201cThe Eroticism of Homeliness.\u201d Over time, their relationship evolves from a tenuous working relationship to a confused sexual entanglement. Martin\u2019s initial repulsion for Tina slowly turns to attraction, causing him to re-evaluate his own notions of beauty and sexuality. Tina\u2019s motives in working for Martin are slowly turned upside-down as well, leading toward the book\u2019s inevitable, explosive ending. Sad, funny, and often uncomfortably titillating,\u00a0Ripple\u00a0is rendered with kinetic realism.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Ripple: A Predilection for Tina"}]}

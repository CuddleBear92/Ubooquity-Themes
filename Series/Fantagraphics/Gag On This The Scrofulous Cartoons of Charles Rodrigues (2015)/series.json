{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "Charles Rodrigues was one of the fiercest, most audacious, taboo-busting cartoonists who ever lived, and our second collection of his cartoons from the National Lampoon may be the most jaw-droppingly potent collection of single gag cartoons ever published. There was no subject Rodrigues wouldn't tackle, and none that he couldn't make funny. There is no example of human suffering, misery, tragedy, or absurdity that is off limits. If they weren't as funny as they in fact are, they would be considered tasteless, repugnant, and horrifying\u2015but without a drop of rancor, even the chapter titled \"Good Ways to kill a Rock Performer.\" There is virtually no way to adequately describe Rodrigues' viciously wicked imagination.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Gag On This: The Scrofulous Cartoons of Charles Rodrigues"}]}

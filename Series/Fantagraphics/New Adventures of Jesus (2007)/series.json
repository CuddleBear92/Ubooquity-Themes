{"metadata": [{"year": "2007", "description": "In this witty addendum to the New Testament, Jesus fulfills his promise \"to reward the just and punish the unjust,\" yet returns to Earth with remarkably little fanfare. He soon realizes he may have postponed his second coming a bit too long, arriving when the planet has fallen into a dangerously advanced state of decrepitude, i.e., the late 20th Century. Nonetheless, Jesus is determined to carry out his sacred obligation. Being half-human, after all, he can relate to the skepticism of the jaded populace and isn't above performing a few parlor tricks to convince those skeptical of his divinity. The main concern, though, is whether or not planet Earth is too far gone. Fantagraphics Books is proud to collect, for the first time, over 40 years worth of The New Adventures of Jesus, including a brand new story by Stack. This edition also features an introduction by R. Crumb and a preface by Gilbert Shelton.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "New Adventures of Jesus"}]}

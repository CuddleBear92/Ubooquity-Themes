{"metadata": [{"year": "2011", "description": "In this new volume of cartoons,\u00a0Twilight of the Assholes, reality gets ever bleaker and Kreider\u2019s humor becomes increasingly apocalyptic, deranged, and hilarious. He juxtaposes the Biblical Christ with His blonde, flag-draped, machine-gun-toting American incarnation in \u201cJesus vs. Jeezus,\u201d proposes a third political party that represents Americans\u2019 real values in \u201cThe Sex Party,\u201d draws the dead Saddam Hussein as a mischievous invisible imp still causing trouble, and envisions the officials of the Bush administration getting their comeuppance in the grisly fashion of\u00a0Dick Tracy\u00a0villains. And he finds two cartoons\u2019 worth of \u201cReasons to Look Forward to the Next Terrorist Attack.\u201d Also included is his infamous entry into Iran\u2019s Holocaust cartoon contest, \u201cSilver Linings of the Holocaust.\u201d", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Twilight of the Assholes: The Chronicles of the Era of Darkness 2005\u20132009"}]}

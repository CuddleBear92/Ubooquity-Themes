{"metadata": [{"year": "2014", "description": "A suite of related short mysteries and thrills, all depicted in Sala's trademark colorful watercolor washes and sharp, detailed line-work. Rising from the crumbling pages of some forgotten (and nonexistent) pulp magazine comes the diabolical villain Super-Enigmatix. Following in the bloody footsteps of master criminals such as Fantomas, Fu Manchu, or Professor Moriarty, Super-Enigmatix is ruthless, cunning, and thoroughly evil. His only goal is to spread fear and cause chaos - but does he want to destroy civilization, or save it? Not even his loyal army of female commandos can guess his real motives, or his true identity. \n\nRichard Sala's books are \"deliriously entertaining\" (Rue Morgue Magazine), \"cinematic and cheerfully over-the-top\" (The New York Times Book Review), containing \"brilliantly atmospheric art, full of shadows and spikes.\" (Booklist) ", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "In A Glass Grotesquely"}]}

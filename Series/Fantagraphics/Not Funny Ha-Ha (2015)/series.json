{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "Not Funny Ha-Ha is a bold, slightly wry graphic novel illustrating the lives of two young women from different cultural, family, and financial backgrounds who go through two different abortions (medical and surgical). It does not address the events leading up to the pregnancy, or even the decision-making before choosing abortion as an option. It simply shows what happens when a woman goes through it, no questions asked. It follows them through the process of choosing a clinic, reaching out to friends, partners, and/or family... and eventually the procedure(s) itself. Despite the fact that so many women and girls have abortions every day, in every city, all around us... it can be a lonely experience. Not Funny Ha-Ha is a little bit technical, a little bit moving, and often funny, in a format uniquely suited to communicate. The book is meant to be a non-judgmental, comforting, even humorous look at what a woman can go through during an abortion. Although the subject matter is heavy, the illustrations are light. The author takes a step back from putting forth any personal opinion whatsoever, simply laying out the events and possible emotional repercussions that could, and often do, occur.\n\n\"This graphic novel is the abortion story that needs to be heard.\" - The Huffington Post\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Not Funny Ha-Ha"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2007", "description": "The Fun Never Stops is a comprehensive collection of premier caricaturist Drew Friedman's best comic strips, illustrations, and mug shots dealing with all the familiar Friedman themes the world has come to love: showbiz has-beens, ugly old white men, nefarious politicians, debauched celebrities, the ubiquitous Lord of Eltingville, etc. Most of the work is from the 1990s, and show Friedman's gradual phasing out of his famous (and amazing) black-and-white stipple look to his current (and equally amazing) lush watercolor style. In addition to the works written by Friedman, Fun includes many collaborations with his longtime partner K. Bidus, as well as Harvey Pekar (American Splendor), Mark Newgarden (We All Die Alone), and Bruce Handy, among others. Also included is artwork from the notorious Topps Bubble Gum Card series Toxic High, as well as art from the card sets Beauties and Cuties and Ed Wood Players.

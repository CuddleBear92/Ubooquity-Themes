Greg Irons was one of the elite among posters artists who worked for Bill Graham's Fillmore Ballroom in San Francisco during the Age of Aquarius, designing posters for Chuck Berry, Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother, and Paul Butterfield. You Call This Art?! reprints his finest psychedelic posters in full-color, as well as complete comic stories from Slow Death Funnies, Legion of Charlies, Deviant Slice, Yellow Dog, Thrilling Murder, and many other underground comic books. It also includes rarely seen album cover art for Jerry Garcia, Blue Cheer, Jefferson Starship and other counterculture musicians.

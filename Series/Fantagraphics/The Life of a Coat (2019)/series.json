{"metadata": [{"year": "2019", "description": "When the father of a large family makes a beautiful winter coat, little does he know how much use it will get. Little Gedalia wears the coat with pride all year, but when it gets too tight for him\u2014he\u2019s a growing boy, after all\u2014it\u2019s given to his sister, Yeshaya. Thus begins the journey of the coat, as it\u2019s passed down from child to child\u2014from the sweet Haya to the rambunctious Efraim and so on\u2014falling apart bit by bit during their play until it\u2019s in tatters. Drawn in a clean-line style with a pleasingly muted color palette, The Life of a Coat is a charming portrait of a loving family. Based on the beloved Yiddish poem by the Polish poet Kadya Molodowsky, this gently humorous tale will\ndelight young readers and their parents.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "The Life of a Coat"}]}

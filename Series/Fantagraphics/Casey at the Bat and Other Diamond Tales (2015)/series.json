{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "In 1953, in conjunction with the fiftieth anniversary of the World Series, legendary cartoonist Willard Mullin created images illustrating one of America's best-loved poems: Ernest Thayer's \"Casey at the Bat.\" These images were then put on a series of drinking glasses that were given away as premiums at various major and minor league ballparks across America. The first set was issued on April 15, 1954, at the very first home game for the modern day Baltimore Orioles.\n\nThe illustrations by Mullin were for years thought to have been lost, but were found at an auction in 2002. They have been meticulously reproduced to create this stunning edition of \"Casey at the Bat.\" This edition will include additional Mullin material like the \"Fan's Alphabet\" from 1953 and the poems \"Iron Horse Lou\" and \"O Brooklyn, My Brooklyn\" from 1947. With a preface by Yogi Berra and an essay on the history of both \"Casey\" and Mullin's images by noted baseball historian Tim Wiles, this edition of \"Casey\" is the most authentic ever produced. A keepsake for the ages.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Casey at the Bat and Other Diamond Tales"}]}

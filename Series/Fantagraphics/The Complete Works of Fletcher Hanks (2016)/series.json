{"metadata": [{"year": "2016", "description": "Fletcher Hanks was the first great comic book auteur: he wrote, penciled, inked, and lettered all of his own stories. He completed approximately 50 stories between 1939-1941, all unified by a unique artistic vision. Whether it's the superhero Stardust doling out ice cold slabs of poetic justice, or the jungle protectress Fantomah tearing evildoers from limb to ragged limb, contemporary readers are stunned by the pop surrealism and outright violent mayhem of Hanks' work. Originally featured in two paperback volumes, this deluxe hardcover collects\u2015for the first time\u2015all of Hanks' previously published material, plus several gems newly discovered for this volume, making this the very first complete collection of the works of Fletcher Hanks.

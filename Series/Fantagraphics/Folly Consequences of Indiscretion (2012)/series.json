Finally, these scattered elements have been compiled into a compact, lushly illustrated bedside reader. Give your cerebellum a tug and become a spelunker of the subconscious as we trespass among the scorched archaic wastelands of the offspring of apes and fools. Here we find the profane, beautiful progeny of prurient ideals. Immerse yourself in the nocturnal meanderings of unnamed protagonists. Ponder the uncomfortable sexuality of the twins, Cochlea & Eustachia. Recoil at the doings of a dwarfish malefactor in \"Hail Jeffrey,\" or simply stare at the pretty pictures. Suffice to say that readers of The Squirrel Machine will not be disappointed.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Folly: Consequences of Indiscretion"}]}

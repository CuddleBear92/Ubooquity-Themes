{"metadata": [{"year": "2010", "description": "This debut collection of short stories are united by their exploration of the great American mythological drama. Tim Lane's characters exist on the margins of society--alienated, floating in the void between hope and despair. Visually reminiscent of Al Feldstein and Charles Burns, Lane's idiosyncratic and tense realism weaves between comic absurdity, nightmarish naturalism, chemical hallucination, and ecstatic terror. Lane's America is a haunted Coney Island, made up of lost characters haplessly shooting themselves in the face, and hopping freight trains in search of Elvis.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Abandoned Cars"}]}

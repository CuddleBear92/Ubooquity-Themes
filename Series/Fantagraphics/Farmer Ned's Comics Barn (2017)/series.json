{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "Finally, what the world has been waiting for - a big, oversized collection of Gerald Jabolonski's psychedelically underground, absurdly avant-garde comics! Jablonski has been comics' best-kept secret for decades, telling the tales of imposter ants, bear-faced grumps, and stoic farmers with pun-laden word balloons that wildly snake around the page. This book also includes a discussion with Gary Groth, the artist's first interview in print. Jablonski belongs in the ingeniously baffling auteur pantheon with John Cage, James Joyce, and Andy Warhol. Yes, you read that right.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Farmer Ned's Comics Barn"}]}

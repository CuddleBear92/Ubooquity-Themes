{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "This is a series of short nearly wordless comics, arranged chronologically, that form a biography of the caricaturist best known for his visualization of the Weimar Republic. George Grosz (1893\u20131959) was a German fine artist, cartoonist, and teacher who drew from pop culture, was active in the Dada and New Objectivist movements, and was an influence for artists like Ben Shahn. (His antiwar painting, Eclipse from the Sun, would inspire Vietnam protesters.) In this graphic biography, written and drawn by Fiske, angular art lays Kandinsky-like lines over scenes set in anything-goes, post\u2013World War I Berlin: connecting, emphasizing, tracing movement. Curves evoke the fleshy sex of Grosz\u2019s work. (Fiske channels the exuberance and fascination with line that typified Grosz\u2019s work, and more generally early to mid-century art movements.) Symbolically, Fiske uses two colors\u2015red for Berlin, a slash of Grosz\u2019s lipstick, a flash of tie\u2015and green for the jazz and trains of New York, where Grosz would flee from Nazi Germany. Fiske\u2019s thoughtful Grosz is a far cry from the plodding pedantry of the graphic hagiographies that earnestly clutter library shelves; it\u2019s a work of art in its own right.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Grosz"}]}

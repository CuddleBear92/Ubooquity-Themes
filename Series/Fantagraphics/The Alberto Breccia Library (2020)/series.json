{"metadata": [{"year": "2020", "description": "Alberto Breccia is recognized as one of the greatest international cartoonists in the history of comics and\u00a0Mort Cinder\u00a0is considered one of his finest achievements. Created in collaboration with the Argentine writer H\u00e9ctor Germ\u00e1n Oesterheld, best known in the U.S. for his politically incendiary sci-fi masterpiece, the Eisner Award-winning\u00a0The Eternaut,\u00a0Mort Cinder\u00a0is a horror story with political overtones.\u00a0This episodic serial, written and drawn between 1962\u20131964, is drawn by Breccia in moody chiaroscuro. The artist\u2019s rubbery, expressionistic faces capture every glint in the eyes of the grave robbers, sailors, and slaves that populate these stories; while the slash of stripes of prisoners\u2019 uniforms, the trapeziums of Babylon, and more create distinct and evocative milieus.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "The Alberto Breccia Library"}]}

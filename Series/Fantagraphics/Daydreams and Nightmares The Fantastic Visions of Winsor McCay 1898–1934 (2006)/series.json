A fantasist of the first rank, McCay was a key pioneer in the histories of both comics and animation.

McCay's dream-inspired strips, illustrations and cartoons feature rarebit-induced nightmares, playful \"what-ifs,\" moralistic panoramas, pictorial allegories and other fantastic visions.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Daydreams and Nightmares: The Fantastic Visions of Winsor McCay 1898\u20131934"}]}

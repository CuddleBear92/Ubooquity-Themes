{"metadata": [{"year": "2013", "description": "Inspired by a real-life incident\u2015getting his tie caught in a moving Moviola editing machine\u2015Gene Deitch, cartoonist, animator, memoirist, renaissance man, created Nudnik, his Everyman character, a cross between Candide and Godot. The star of 12 Paramount-produced animated shorts that ran in theatres as an opening to the main movie in 1964 and 1965, Nudnik was one of Deitch\u2019s most creatively personal and commercially successful creations in a long career of innovative and successful work, including the award-winning animated versions of Jules Feiffer\u2019s\u00a0Munroand Maurice Sendak\u2019s\u00a0Where the Wild Things Are. Nudnik is the well-intentioned, kind, cheerful, but bumbling naif, inspired by and reflecting such archetypal characters as Jackie Gleason\u2019s Poor Soul, Charlie Chaplin\u2019s Tramp, and Charles Schulz\u2019s Charlie Brown. He never gets a break, can\u2019t do anything right, but somehow muddles through, dignity more or less intact.\u00a0Nudnik Revealed!\u00a0finally collects all of Deitch\u2019s original drawings, sketches, model sheets, storyboards, and color \u201cset-ups\u201d that he drew during the Nudnik production season of \u201964-\u201965, all reproduced from original art, showcasing his lively pencil line and his slick, authoritative pen and ink work. Deitch, a born storyteller and one of the great raconteurs of comics and animation, accompanies the copious examples of art with a running commentary\u2015by turns, funny, spirited, and chock full of historical insights.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Nudnik Revealed!"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "Ron Reg\u00e9, Jr. is a very unusual yet accomplished storyteller whose work exudes a passionate moral, idealistic core that sets him apart from his peers. The Cartoon Utopia is his Magnum Opus, a unique work of comic art that, in the words of its author, \"focuses on ideas that I've become intrigued by that stem from magical, alchemical, ancient ideas & mystery schools.\" It's part sci-fi, part philosophy, part visual poetry, and part social manifesto. Reg\u00e9's work exudes psychedelia, outsider rawness, and pure cartoonish joy.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "The Cartoon Utopia"}]}

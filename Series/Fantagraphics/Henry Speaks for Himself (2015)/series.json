{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "What is it about odd-looking comic strip characters that catch the public\u2019s attention? Carl Anderson\u2019s classic comic strip character Henry was certainly not your average-looking youngster, with knobby knees, a pencil neck, and a bulbous, bald head but, for years, he entertained millions of readers worldwide with his pantomime pranks. He was also the subject of a long-running comic book series, with one significant difference from the newspaper strip \u2013 in the comic books, Henry spoke! Written and drawn by John Liney, who also handled art chores on the daily Henry strip, these stories were done in a Tintin-esque clean-line art style that made them attractive to the younger set, but with writing clever enough to cause the adults to chuckle while reading to their children. These 1940s-\u201950s stories have never before been reprinted, and this collection provides a long-overdue look at a forgotten \u201ckid\u2019s comic\u201d masterpiece.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Henry Speaks for Himself"}]}

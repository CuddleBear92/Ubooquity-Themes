In 1972, Wallace Wood created Shattuck, a rarely seen Western comic strip, assisted by soon-to-be great cartoonists Dave Cockrum (X-Men) and Howard Chaykin (Star Wars, Punisher). Full of gun-toting femmes fatale, fast-drawing lawmen, and snarling outlaws, this spurs 'n' saddles romp will be published in the same beautifully designed and affordable format as Fantagraphics's best-selling Cannon.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Shattuck"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2005", "description": "Carol Tyler has been a professional (and highly acclaimed) cartoonist for over 20 years, appearing in such venues as Weirdo, Wimmen's Comix, and Drawn & Quarterly magazine. But over the years her status as a working mother has drastically curtailed her ability to set aside time for her cartooning. Thus each rare new story from her pen has been greeted with hurrahsas well they should be, because she's one of the most skillful, caustic, and emphatic cartoon storytellers of her generation. This new book presents the biggest, richest and most delightful collection of Tyler's work to date featuring many new and previously unpublished works.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Late Bloomer"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2009", "description": "Set in sun-drenched Cape Town, South Africa, this book features two full-length stories, \"The Leaking Cello Case\" and \"John Wesley Harding,\" rife with mystery, suspense, action, adventure, conspiracy theories, cool cars and excellent weed. Joe Daly brings a refreshingly original -- and utterly hilarious -- voice to the comics medium, a dry, deadpan wit anchored in everyday reality combined with unnervingly deranged plots, rendered with a hyper-detailed, half-realistic and half-cartoony Tintin-style crispness. \n\n\"[The Red Monkey Double Happiness Book] is basically Herge by way of the Big Lebowski with a little bit of Repo Man thrown in for good measure.... very funny...\" -- Chris Mautner, Robot 6\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "The Red Monkey Double Happiness Book"}]}

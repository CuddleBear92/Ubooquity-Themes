{"metadata": [{"year": "2011", "description": "In Mascots, a collection of impressionistic stories combine to create a wildly absurd\u2015yet vaguely familiar\u2015parallel world. Like Fenwick's previous work, the acclaimed Hall of Best Knowledge (one ofBooklist's \"Top Ten Graphic Novels of 2008\"), Mascots is driven by lettering and language, part art and part comics, this time taking the form of bright, full-color paintings on found book covers. These paintings can be experienced individually, each on their own terms, but together they reveal a surreal world that captures the mood of our times with manic energy.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Mascots"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2009", "description": "The best of Sally's acclaimed short stories from the past 15 years, including the complete first two issues of Recidivist, navigating the messy and murky waters of human experience with unflinching veracity. One man's heartfelt and irreverent record of his time on this rock, Zak Sally's unflinchingly veracious book, Like a Dog, is both direct and oblique, which we find rather miraculous considering the messy and murky waters of human experience it manages to navigate. Like a Dog is among the few comic book testimonials burdened by the yen to understand and articulate the mundane and the magnificent. Don't be surprised if you find yourself laughing and crying as you claw your way through each hard fought page!", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Like a Dog"}]}

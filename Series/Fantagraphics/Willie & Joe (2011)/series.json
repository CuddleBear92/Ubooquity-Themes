This book brings together Mauldin\u2019s complete works from 1940 through the end of the war under one cover. This collection of over 600 cartoons, most never before reprinted, is more than the record of a great artist: it is an essential chronicle of America\u2019s citizen-soldiers from peace through war to victory.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Willie & Joe"}]}

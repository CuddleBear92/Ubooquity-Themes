{"metadata": [{"year": "2006", "description": "This companion volume to Will Elder: The Mad Playboy of Art peeks into the gray matter of one of comics' most fertile and wide-ranging imaginations. Elder coined the term \"chicken fat\" to describe the myriad background gags crammed into his stories for MAD, Panic, Humbug, Goodman Beaver and Little Annie Fanny: \"It's the part of the chicken soup that is bad for you, yet gives the soup its delicious flavor,\" he once explained. Chicken Fat is a collection of flavors by a master comedic chef as he works out his recipes. This is a collection of sketches, drawings and a variety of obscure commercial illustration over the course of Elder's long career.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Chicken Fat"}]}

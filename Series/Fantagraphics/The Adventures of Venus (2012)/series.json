{"metadata": [{"year": "2012", "description": "A rare foray into all-ages work, \"The Adventures of Venus\" was Gilbert Hernandez's contribution to the kids' anthology Measles which he edited in 1999 and 2000. This volume collects all the previously uncollected \"Venus\" stories from Measles in which Luba's niece creates and collects comic books, walks through a scary forest, plays soccer, schemes to get the cute boy she likes, laments the snowlessness of a California Christmas, catches measles, and travels to a distant planet (OK, the last one may be a dream). Plus a new story done just for this book!\n\n\"I love that this graphic novel is full of characters from different cultures with different appearances. Venus and her sister live with their bodybuilder-like mom and no dad, Venus's rival, Gilda Gonzalez, is Hispanic and her crush, Yoshio, is Asian. It's refreshing to see all these different types of people together and getting along normally.\"-- Sheena McNeil\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "The Adventures of Venus"}]}

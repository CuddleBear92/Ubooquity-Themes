{"metadata": [{"year": "2007", "description": "Edward Sorel is widely recognized as America's premier illustrator. But when he wasn't painting covers and doing drawings for The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Time, Rolling Stone, and many other mass circulation magazines, he was indulging, over the last 30 years, in his first love\u2014making comic strips. Sorel's strips are iconoclastic, cynical, and universally excoriating. No target escapes his watchful wrath: politicians, theological dynasties, ideologues left and right, lawyers, publishers, and the usual gang of movers and shakers\u2014panderers, philistines, money-grubbers. (Nor does he spare himself.) Culled from the pages of The Nation, The Village Voice, Penthouse, and other magazines, Sorel proves he is that most dangerous of creatures\u2014a cartoonist with a chip on his shoulder, an inveterate troublemaker, a burner of bridges.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Just When You Thought Things Couldn't Get Worse: The Cartoons and Comic Strips of Edward Sorel"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2007", "description": "In 1955, Gene Deitch embarked on a daily comic strip for United Features Syndicate that he hoped would become his life's work. One of the most unusual strips of the decade, Terr'ble Thompson was about a very odd little boy who had his \"Werld Hedd Quarters\" in a tree house and was regarded far and wide as \"the bravest, fiercest, most-best hero of all-time.\" Terr'ble Thompson collects the entirety of Deitch's short-lived inspiration for Tom Terrific, and a new generation will discover what could have been one of the great comic strips of all-time had it continued. The strip is drawn in a simple, modernist style that served as an antidote to the ubiquitous Disney look that had spread into all facets of popular culture. Terr'ble Thompson was a visual and verbal feast of fun that blended time and space, with Terr'ble going on adventures with great historic figures like Columbus, George Washington, and Davy Crockett.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Terr'ble Thompson"}]}

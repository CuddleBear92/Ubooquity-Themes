{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "Since their original publication, Peanuts Sundays have almost always been collected and reprinted in black and white, and generations of Peanuts fans have grown up enjoying this iteration of these strips. But many who read Peanuts in their original Sunday papers remain fond of the striking coloring, which makes for a surprisingly different reading experience. It is for these fans (and for Peanuts fans in general who want to experience this alternate/original version) that we now present a series of larger, Sundays-only Peanuts reprints. As with most strips, Peanuts showed by far the quickest and richest development in its first decade, and Peanuts Every Sunday: 1952-1955, by compiling every strip from the first four years, offers a fascinating peek at Schulz's evolving creative process. Not only does the graphic side of the strips change drastically, from the strip's initial stiff, ultra-simple stylizations through a period of uncommonly lush, detailed drawings to something close to the final, elegant Peanuts style we've all come to know and love, but several main characters are gradually introduced \u2015 oddly enough, usually as infants who would then grow up to full, articulate Peanut-hood! \u2015 and then refined: Schroeder, Lucy, and Linus.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Peanuts Every Sunday"}]}

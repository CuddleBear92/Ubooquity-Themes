{"metadata": [{"year": "2019", "description": "Spanish cartoonist Ana Galva\u00f1 charts an often-psychedelic and existential course for modernity in her English language debut, utilizing swaths of electric and florescent colors to create a series of short stories that intertwine and explore the dehumanizing effects of contemporary society. Like a candycolored collection of Black Mirror episodes, Galva\u00f1\u2019s world, set in the very near-future, is familiar and cautionary at once. Galva\u00f1\u2019s unwitting and addictive characters navigate a world of iridescent pastels and geometric energy like puppets. Departments of inhumane resources dehumanize the people it is purported to protect; information is determinedly mined like the gold of the 21st century that it is; induced suicidal thoughts are a tool to manage overpopulation. Galva\u00f1\u2019s near future is less paranoid dystopia than it is a logical extension of things to come, where the malice of large corporations manifests in small, everyday ways\u2014real if a bit surreal at the same time.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Press Enter to Continue"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2012", "description": "Originally serialized in Love and Rockets: New Stories 1 & 2, \"Ti-Girls Adventures\" managed to be both a rollickingly creative super-hero joyride (featuring three separate super-teams and over two dozen characters) that ranged from the other side of the universe to Maggie's shabby apartment, and a genuinely dramatic fable about madness, grief, and motherhood as Penny Century's decades-long quest to become a genuine super-heroine are finally, and tragically, fulfilled. In addition to introducing a plethora of wild new characters, God and Science brings in many older characters from Jaime's universe, some from seemingly throwaway shorter strips and some from Maggie's day-to-day world (including some real surprises). The main heroine of the story, forming a bridge between the \"realistic\" Maggie stories and the super-heroic extravaganza is \"Angel,\" Maggie's sweet-tempered and athletic new roommate and best friend, and now herself an aspiring super-heroine. Aside from being presented in a large format that really displays Jaime Hernandez's stunning art, God and Science will be a \"director's cut\" version that includes a full 30 new pages in addition to the original 100-page epic, including four new full-color faux Ti-Girls covers, several expansions of scenes, an epilogue set back in Maggie's apartment, and a long fantasy/timewarp sequence that draws the focus back on Penny's awful predicament. \n\n\"For what's essentially an evocative throwback to the kid's superhero comics of yore, there's a lot going on here--youth versus seasoned oldsters, absolute power corrupting absolutely, mother/child dysfunction--and it's all wrapped up in a package of terrific dialogue, stellar artwork, and enough raw fun to drown in.\" - Publishers Weekly\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "God and Science: Return of the Ti-Girls"}]}

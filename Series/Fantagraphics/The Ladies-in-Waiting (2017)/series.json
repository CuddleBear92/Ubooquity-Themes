{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "In 1656, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, leading figure in the Spanish Golden Age of painting, created one of the most enigmatic works in the history of art: Las Meninas (The Ladies-in-Waiting). This graphic novel, written and drawn by two of Spain's most sophisticated comics creators, examines its legacy as one of the first paintings to explore the relationship among the viewer, reality, and unreality. (It guest stars Cano, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Zurbar\u00e1n, and many others.) Olivares's art moves from clear line to expressionistic; from pen nib to brush stokes; from one color palette to another, as The Ladies-in-Waiting uses fiction to explore the ties among artists and patrons, the past and the present, institutions and audiences, creators and creativity.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "The Ladies-in-Waiting"}]}

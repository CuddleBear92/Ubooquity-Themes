{"metadata": [{"year": "2005", "description": "The Freebooters\u00a0is a lively, character-driven graphic narrative set in a fantastic, ancient milieu that superficially bears resemblance to a world that will be familiar to longtime Windsor-Smith fans who remember his work on another famous warrior. This volume collects the entirety of Windsor-Smith's \"The Freebooter\" stories from the acclaimed BWS: Storyteller comic book series from the early 1990s, including a full-length chapter from the unpublished tenth issue, plus more than 50 pages of new story. The Freebooters is amongst the most raucous and literate comics of Windsor-Smith's career, the culmination of a lifetime of experience and knowledge, approaching his comics with a seriousness of purpose while never losing his unmistakable sense of humor. A ripping good yarn!\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "The Freebooters"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2009", "description": "For over thirty years Nell Brinkley's beautiful girls pirouetted, waltzed, Charlestoned, vamped and shimmied their way through the pages of William Randolph Hearst's newspapers, captivating the American public with their innocent sexuality. This sumptuously designed oversized hardcover collects Brinkley's breathtakingly spectacular, exquisitely colored full page art from 1913 to 1940. Here are her earliest silent movie serial-inspired adventure series, \"Golden Eyes and Her Hero, Bill;\" her almost too romantic series, \"Betty and Billy and Their Love Through the Ages;\" her snappy flapper comics from the 1920s; her 1937 pulp magazine-inspired \"Heroines of Today.\" Included are photos of Nell, reproductions of her hitherto unpublished paintings, and an informative introduction by the book's editor, Trina Robbins.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "The Brinkley Girls"}]}

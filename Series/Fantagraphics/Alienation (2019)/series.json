{"metadata": [{"year": "2019", "description": "Drawn in hazy gray pencil and printed in blue pantone ink, this book is about Elizabeth, an exotic dancer in cyberspace, and Carlos, who was just fired from the last human-staffed oil rig, attempting to keep their romance alive. When they realize that their bodies are full of artificial organs and they live almost entirely online, they begin to question what being human actually means. Do our ancestral, or even animal, instincts eventually kick in, or are we transcending the limits of our bodies? When an unplanned pregnancy is caused by an AI hack, Elizabeth must decide if the child is the next step in evolution \u2015 or a glitch that will wipe out humanity once and for all.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Alienation"}]}

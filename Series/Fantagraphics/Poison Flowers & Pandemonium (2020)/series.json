In the graphic novella \"The Amazing Adventures of Fantomina Fantomella,\" the titular heroine is presumed dead \u2015 but the mob realizes they were wrong when she visits her vengeance on the city's evildoers. In \"Cave Girls Of The Lost World,\" a group of stranded schoolgirls realizes they are cut off from civilization in a land forgotten by time and rife with dinosaurs, carnivorous plants, and apemen \u2015 but these intelligent, brave, and resourceful women are ready to rumble! This adventure story is a showcase for Sala's lovely watercolor artwork and his love of B-movies. The third and final section is \"Monsters Illustrated.\" A young woman enters a strange old bookstore and begins reading a catalog of monsters. This \"book within a book\" is presented with watercolor and ink drawings. What will happen when she reaches the end?", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Poison Flowers & Pandemonium"}]}

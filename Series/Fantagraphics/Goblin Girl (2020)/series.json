{"metadata": [{"year": "2020", "description": "A dating site match goes really wrong in this troubling, funny graphic memoir. Things seem to be looking up when Moa Romanova \u2015 broke, depressed, and living in a squat above an old store \u2015 matches with a very famous celebrity on a popular hook-up site. Not only does the 53-year-old man like Moa \u2015 he also immediately validates and motivates her in a way that not even her therapist does, even offering to help financially support her artistic ambitions. However, Moa soon discovers that there are strings attached. Drawn in a style that's de Chirico by way of the '80s, Romanova's relatable graphic memoir is a thought-provoking debut.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Goblin Girl"}]}

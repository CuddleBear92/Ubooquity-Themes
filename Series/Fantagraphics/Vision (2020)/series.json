To escape it all, she engages in a sexual relationship with a haunted mirror in her bedroom. Gfr\u00f6rer's delicate and dark line-work perfectly complements the period era of the book's setting, bringing the lyricism and romanticism of her stories to the fore.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Vision"}]}

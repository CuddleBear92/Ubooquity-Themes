Underworld hilariously depicts sordid doings in a surreal city, stuffed with almost-parodies of famous comic strip characters, a healthy dose of cigarette-smoking cats, cute little saccharin-cuddly creatures, media-damaged kids, and much more - all destined for a sardonic smashing in typically acerbic Kaz fashion.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Underworld"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2020", "description": "In this book, Lane remasters milieus, attitudes, and cultural touchstones of the 20th century: wry slice-of-life vignettes are depicted in moodily crosshatched, noir-inflected drawings. Jazz clubs and pool halls, ballparks and graveyards, casinos and coffeehouses, back alleys and bus stops are populated by roughed-up boxers, bleary gamblers, rowdy winos, philosophical rail-riders, acrobatic fire-swallowers, and femme fatales - woven together into a uniquely designed collection of images and prose.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Toybox Americana"}]}

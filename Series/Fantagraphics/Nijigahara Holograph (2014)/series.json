{"metadata": [{"year": "2014", "description": "Even as butterflies ominously proliferate in town, the rumor of a mysterious creature lurking in the tunnel behind the school spreads among the children. When the body of Ari\u00e9 Kimura's mother is found by this tunnel's entrance, next to apparently human traces, the legend seems to be confirmed. Is the end of the world coming? In order to appease the wrath of the beast, the children decide to offer it a sacrifice: The unfortunate Ari\u00e9, whom they believe to be the cause of the curse, is shoved into a well that leads to the Nijigahara tunnel \u2015 an act that in turns pushes Komatsuzaki, the budding thug who has carried a torch for Ari\u00e9 for a while already, entirely over the edge. But this is only the beginning of the complex, challenging, obliquely told Nijigahara Holograph, which takes place in two separate timelines and involves the suicidal Suzuki; Higure, his stalkerish would-be girlfriend; and their teacher Miss Sakaki, whose heavily bandaged face remains a mystery; and many more \u2015 brothers, sisters, parents, co-workers, teachers, aggressors and victims who are all inextricably linked to one another and all will eventually \u2015 ten years later \u2015 have to live with what they've done or suffered through.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Nijigahara Holograph"}]}

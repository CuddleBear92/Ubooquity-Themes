{"metadata": [{"year": "2020", "description": "In late 2004, Vivian Chong\u2019s life was changed forever when a rare skin disease, TEN (Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis), left her with scar tissue that would eventually blind her. As she was losing her sight, she put down as many drawings on paper as she could to document the experience. In\u00a0Dancing After TEN, Chong teams up with cartoonist Georgia Webber \u2015 whose graphic autobiography,\u00a0Dumb, chronicled her own disability \u2015 to trace her journey out of the darkness and into the spotlight. Chong now expresses her art through singing, stand-up, drumming, running, and dancing. This graphic novel is an inspirational tale and a powerful work of graphic medicine.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Dancing after TEN"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2018", "description": "A corporation invents a device that can talk to God in this graphic novel thriller. Godhead ricochets from the streets of a working-class African American community to the glimmering halls of corporate America to a mobile scientific laboratory located in the Pacific Ocean. A sprawling contemporary saga with a science-fiction edge, Godhead explores a collision course between science and religion when a corporation creates a device that can talk to God. Is this humanity\u2019s salvation or the equivalent of a Doomsday machine? Godhead is Ho Che Anderson\u2019s most conceptually and thematically ambitious graphic novel to date, his first in over ten years. Visually, he employs a variety of drawing techniques from tonal images to stark black-and-white to full color painting in order to convey a thriller that ranges from intimate domestic drama to globalist corporate intrigue.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Godhead"}]}

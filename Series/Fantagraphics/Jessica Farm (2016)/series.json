{"metadata": [{"year": "2016", "description": "Jessica Farm\u00a0fuses serialized adventure, fantasy and psychological horror and stamps it with Josh Simmon\u2019s signature macabre sensibility. Like a Lynchian take on\u00a0Alice in Wonderland,Jessica Farmopens with an exterior of what could be any Midwestern farmhouse. Once inside, we track our titular heroine as she bounds out of bed on Christmas and goes about her morning routine, eventually breakfasting with her grandparents. The banality of the situation is subverted by a ratcheting sense of dread, as we discover that Jessica\u2019s increasingly nightmarish house is filled with creatures around every corner: some whimsical, some sexual, some despairing and some malevolent. Most terrifying of all is Jessica\u2019s father, whose promise of presents under the tree is loaded with the threat of violence.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Jessica Farm"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2013", "description": "A mysterious traveler gets off the train in a small village surrounded by a thick sinister forest. He is searching for Delphine, who vanished with only a scrawled-out address on a scrap of paper as a trace. Richard Sala takes the tale of Snow White and stands it on its head, retelling it from Prince Charming's perspective (the unnamed traveler) in a contemporary setting. This twisted tale includes all the elements of terror from the original fairy tale, with none of the insipid saccharine coating of the Disney animated adaptation: Yes, there will be blood. Delphine is executed in a rich and ominous duotone that shows off Sala's virtuosity-- punctuated with stunning full-color chapter breaks. \n\n\"I adore Richard Sala's Delphine.\" - Junot Diaz\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Delphine, Vol. 1"}]}

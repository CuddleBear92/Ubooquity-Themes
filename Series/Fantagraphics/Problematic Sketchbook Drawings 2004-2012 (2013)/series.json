{"metadata": [{"year": "2013", "description": "If you are one of the fortunate thousands who enjoy untangling the enigmatic images that fill Jim Woodring's comics and drawings, Problematic is just the book for you to put under your pillow and dream on. Woodring is a devotee of the pocket-sized Moleskine sketchbook and has filled at least one per month since 2004. Quick concept sketches, figure studies, self-challenges, finished drawings, revenge portraits and caricatures, scene tryouts... everything goes into these idea batteries. Problematic provides the adventurous viewer with a bounty of unfiltered, hand-captured glimpses of life by an artist that Publishers Weekly called \"a modern master of hallucinatory cartoon fables.\" ", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Problematic: Sketchbook Drawings 2004-2012"}]}

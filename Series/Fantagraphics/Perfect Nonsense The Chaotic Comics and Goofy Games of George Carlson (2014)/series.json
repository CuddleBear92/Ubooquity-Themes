{"metadata": [{"year": "2014", "description": "Perfect Nonsense tells the complete story behind one of the most innovative and under-rated Golden Age artists, classic children's illustrators, and nonsense poets in American history. For more than 50 years, George Carlson created thousands of distinctive and dynamic cartoons, comics, riddles, and games that thrilled both children and adults with their fanciful spirit and nonsensical humor. There has never been a career retrospective of this startling cartoonist and illustrator \u2015 until now! Carlson's inspired cartoons \u2015 ranging from the intellectual to the surreal \u2015 place him at home with not only acknowledged masters of American humor like George Herriman, S. J. Perelman, Milt Gross, Bill Holman, and Jack Kent, but also globally celebrated absurdists like Beckett, Pirandello, and his life-long inspiration, Lewis Carroll.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Perfect Nonsense: The Chaotic Comics and Goofy Games of George Carlson"}]}

For casual readers and fans, Bread & Wine is a moving, sexually charged love story, with visuals informed by Wolff's professional physical pursuits. Her black-and-white, pen-and-ink work not only expressionistically represents the characters' \"body language\" and the bustling New York setting, but is also filled with impish art references and visual puns. The scholarly potential for the book, based on the poem \"Bread and Wine\" by the German lyric poet Friedrich Holderlin, not only encompasses queer, African-American, and graphic novel studies, but also exploration in the literary and paraliterary academic fields. This edition includes an introduction by Watchmen writer Alan Moore, commentary by the book's protagonists, Delany and Dennis, and a new interview with Delany and Wolff.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Bread & Wine: An Erotic Tale of New York"}]}

So get out your handkerchiefs and enjoy the trials, tribulations, tragedies and triumphs of Suzi, Marjorie, Annaliese, Toni, Kathy, Sari... and 15 other star-crossed young lovers from half a century ago. \n\n\"Simon and Kirby tried to bring as much excitement to primarily psychological and interpersonal goings-on as to punching and flying.\" -Hillary Brown, Paste Magazine", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Young Romance: Simon & Kirby 1940-1950"}]}

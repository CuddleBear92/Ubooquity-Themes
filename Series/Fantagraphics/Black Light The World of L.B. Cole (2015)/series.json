{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "L.B. Cole created some of the most bizarre, proto-psychedelic, eye-popping comic book covers of all time, yet remarkably this is the first retrospective of his career, featuring the largest collection of Cole covers ever assembled, in an oversize format that showcases his attention to detail and his versatility in all the popular comic book genres of the day. Cole burst into comics during the glory years of the Golden Age of comics. He was famous for his bold covers, usually featuring \"poster colors\" \u2015 brilliant primaries often over black backgrounds \u2015 and an over-the-top sense of the bizarre mixed with whimsy. There's never been a comic book cover designer like L.B. Cole and there's never been a book like this one.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Black Light: The World of L.B. Cole"}]}

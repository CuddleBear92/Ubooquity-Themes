Frank discussions of sexuality and other adult material are important parts of her story, and as such, reader discretion is strongly advised. \n\n\nA long, dense, sensitive, and minutely observed autobiographical masterpiece recalling the summer of 1984, when the artist, a rebellious, punked-out 17-year-old, hitchhiked her way across Italy. 2011 Angoul\u00eame prize winner. \n\n\"Ulli Lust really nails my favorite part of storytelling. Bumming cigarettes, learning how to hitchhike -- the small details that create great character.\" -- Jaime Hernandez\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Today Is the Last Day of the Rest of Your Life"}]}

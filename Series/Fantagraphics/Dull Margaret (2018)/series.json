The\u00a0Dulle Grietpainting shows a breastplated woman with a sword in one hand in front of the mouth of hell, and Broadbent uses that single, vivid image as a launching point to explore what the rest of Dull Margaret\u2019s bleak existence may have been like.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Dull Margaret"}]}

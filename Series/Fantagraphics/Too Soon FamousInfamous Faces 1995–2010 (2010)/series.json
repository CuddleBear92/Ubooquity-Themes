{"metadata": [{"year": "2010", "description": "With\u00a0Too Soon? Drew Friedman finally (none \u201ctoo soon,\u201d in fact) gets his due with this fat, beautiful collection that showcases his wide-ranging skills as a portraitist and caricaturist. Subjects (or targets, depending on how you look at it) for Friedman\u2019s pen on the political side include Bill and Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, John McCain, and George W. Bush (with an iconic \u201cW. as Strangelove\u201d image) and his gang. Entertainers include Tiny Tim, Barney Fife, Bob Dylan, Woody Allen, Oprah Winfrey, Barbra Streisand, Jerry Lewis, the Three Stooges, Ellen DeGeneres, and Conan O\u2019Brien. And falling somewhere in the gray area between entertainers and political players (you make the call!) Rush Limbaugh (who blasted Friedman\u2019s George W. Bush image as being of \u201clow artistic quality\u201d), Sarah Palin, and Michael Moore.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Too Soon?

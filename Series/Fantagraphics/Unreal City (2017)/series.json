{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "Unreal City contains five highly charged stories about relationships: \"Echoes into Eternity,\" \"Evelyn Dalton-Hoyt,\" \"Emordana,\" \"The Yellowknife Retrospective,\" and \"Objet d'Art.\" The stories address gender, narcissism, marriage, subjectivity, objectification, and the thin line that divides love from hate. Bryant's characters sometimes feel like they are navigating their way through the darkness in an attempt to make sense of love, sex, art, and life. Existential and elliptical, the stories play beautifully against Bryant's precise and fully-realized artwork, which echoes such masters as Jaime Hernandez and Daniel Clowes. In Unreal City, characters cannot walk into a room without their world turning inside out. Readers will be similarly upended by the discovery of this major new talent.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Unreal City"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2003", "description": "An evocative murder mystery set in the Norwegian countryside, this story, like all good murder mysteries, is a stew of passion, buried past crimes, revelations, and sharply defined characters who remain ambiguous to the very end. Norwegian author Stein Riverton's 1908 novel The Iron Wagon has never been translated into English. Now, using a striking two-color drawing style and re-casting the story with his iconic animal characters from his previous graphic novel Sshhhh!, the acclaimed cartoonist Jason has adapted The Iron Wagon into an original graphic novel that will appeal not only to fans of his work but also to mystery fans who will finally have a chance to experience Riverton's clever story. \n\n\"Jason's work will haunt you long after you've put it down.\" - AintItCool.com ", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "The Iron Wagon"}]}

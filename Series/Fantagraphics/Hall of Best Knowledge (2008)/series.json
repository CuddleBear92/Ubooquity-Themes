{"metadata": [{"year": "2008", "description": "Ray Fenwick has pioneered his own medium of storytelling, one best described as \"typographical comics.\" Hall of Best Knowledge is presented as a handsome, personal journal written by an unnamed voice, referred to only as \"The Author.\" Little is known about him; he makes occasional, derogatory references to a twin brother and younger sibling, but reveals little else. He clearly fashions himself a genius, writing with a faux-aristocratic air, and it is presumably his belief in his own genius that leads him to want to share his knowledge with the world. Each page features information such as \"It hardly needs mentioning that riding a pony is no intellectual triumph.... If riding a pony is so fantastic, why have I never read of any renowned pony-riding genius? It is because such a person does not exist, making it a foolish waste of time unworthy of attention.\" These pearls of wisdom are lettered in an elegant, almost obsessive fashion, entirely hand-crafted and bedecked with Ionic columns and fleurs-de-lis.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Hall of Best Knowledge"}]}

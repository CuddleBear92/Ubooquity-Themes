{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "Fantagraphics is proud to publish this edition of TeotFW in conjunction with the 2017 television drama on UK's Channel 4 (with distribution via Netflix in the U.S.) Originally released to critical and public acclaim in 2013, Charles Forsman's graphic novel debut follows James and Alyssa, two teenagers living a seemingly typical teen experience as they face the fear of coming adulthood. Forsman tells their story through each character's perspective, jumping between points of view with each chapter. But quickly, this somewhat familiar teenage experience takes a more nihilistic turn as James's character exhibits a rapidly forming sociopathy that threatens both of their futures. He harbors violent fantasies and begins to act on them, while Alyssa remains as willfully ignorant for as long as she can, blinded by young love.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "TEOTFW"}]}

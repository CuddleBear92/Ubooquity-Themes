{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "Everything that you need to know about reading, making, and understanding comics can be found in a single\u00a0Nancy\u00a0strip by Ernie Bushmiller from August 8, 1959. Paul Karasik and Mark Newgarden\u2019s groundbreaking work\u00a0How to Read Nancy\u00a0ingeniously isolates the separate building blocks of the language of comics through the deconstruction of a single strip. No other book on comics has taken such a simple yet methodical approach to laying bare how the comics medium really works. No other book of any kind has taken a single work by any artist and minutely (and entertainingly) pulled it apart like this.\u00a0How to Read Nancy\u00a0is a completely new approach towards deep-reading art. In addition,\u00a0How to Read Nancy\u00a0is a thoroughly researched history of how comics are made, from their creation at the drawing board to their ultimate destination at the bookstore. Textbook, art book, monogram, dissection,\u00a0How to Read Nancy\u00a0is a game changer in understanding how the \u201csimplest\u201d drawings grab us and never leave. Perfect for students, academics, scholars, and casual fans.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "How to Read Nancy"}]}

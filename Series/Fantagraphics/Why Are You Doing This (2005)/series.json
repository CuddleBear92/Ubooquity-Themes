{"metadata": [{"year": "2005", "description": "A moody twenty-something wallowing in depression after a breakup with his long-time girlfriend, finds himself drawn into a paranoid's worst nightmare after his best friend is murdered and the blame is pinned on him. With the help of a single mother who spontaneously throws in her lot with him (not to mention her precocious daughter), he sets out to clear his name. Soon new relationships are forged, dark secrets from the past are revealed, and the real killer comes back into the picture...with a vengeance. \"Typically for a Jason book, Why Are You Doing This? builds to a gut-punch ending that attempts to answer the titular question. Why do people fall in love, chase each other, kill each other? Because this is a story, and stories need to be interesting.\" - \"The Best Comics of the '00s,\" The A.V. Club ", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Why Are You Doing This"}]}

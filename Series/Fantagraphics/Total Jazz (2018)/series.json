{"metadata": [{"year": "2018", "description": "Blutch riffs on two quintessentially American art forms \u2014 jazz and comics. In this freewheeling collection of short stories and vignettes, the famed French cartoonist examines not only the music, but the nature of the jazz sub-culture. The grumpy festival goer, the curmudgeonly collector, and many other fan \u201ctypes\u201d are the targets of his unerring gimlet eye. Drawn in a range of styles as improvisational as Coltrane and Mingus \u2015 everything from loose linework to tight pen and ink to gestural pencils \u2015 Blutch captures the excitement of live performance, the lovelorn, and the Great Jazz Detective, who is out but not down.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Total Jazz"}]}

Santiago's artwork is superb and the depth of his passion for the subject and incredible preparation comes through on every page.\" -- Steven Goldman, author of Forging Genius: The Making of Casey Stengel and editor of Baseball Prospectus\n\n\"I'll admit, being a baseball player often feels like a comic book experience: the costumes, the origins, the battles for great victories and inspiration it conjures in our fellow man. This book captures the essence of one of our sport's greatest heroes, and it does so in a way that engages the imaginations as much as it reveals the heart, ink, color, style, and character; I can think of no better way to share a tale of a true legend.\" -- Dirk Hayhurst, Toronto Blue Jays pitcher and author of The Bullpen Gospels\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "21: The Story of Roberto Clemente"}]}

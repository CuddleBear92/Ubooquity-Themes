{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "This graphic novel unfolds in front of the reader as a puzzle of short stories and moment-capturing images. Samuel is a pale, ghost-like character, drawn in clear line, against the controlled psychedelia of color and form. He exists almost invisible to his surroundings, a hero of the ordinary. Musturi's precise storytelling is about individuality and loneliness among others, and of freedom, pondering our daily actions and the choices and values behind them, all evidenced by Samuel's peculiar actions.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Simply Samuel"}]}

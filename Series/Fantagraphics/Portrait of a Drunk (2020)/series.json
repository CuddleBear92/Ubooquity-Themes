{"metadata": [{"year": "2020", "description": "In this graphic novel, three cutting-edge, world-renowned cartoonists team up to tell a tale of an 18th-century pirate \u2015 one who's more gallows fodder than a Hollywood swashbuckler. Guy is no master mariner, with a clipped red (or black) beard. He's just an ordinary member of the crew \u2015 able enough, but also a lazy, cowardly liar, a drunkard, and a thief. His story is told in two allegorical parts: \"The Blowout\" and \"The Hangover.\" Three contemporary comics titans, Belgian Olivier Schrauwen (Parallel Lives) and the French duo Ruppert and Mulot (The Perineum Technique) collaborate to bring you the best pictorial and narrative elements of the great tales of the sea \u2015 bright colors, grand battles, gallows humor \u2015 in this tour de force of black comedy.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Portrait of a Drunk"}]}

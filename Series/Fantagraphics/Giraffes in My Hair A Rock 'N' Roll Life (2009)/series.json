{"metadata": [{"year": "2009", "description": "Bruce Paley turned 18 in 1967 during the Summer of Love, putting him on the front lines of the late-1960s youth movement. Paley's tumultuous journey took him from being a Jack Kerouac-loving hippie in the 1960s, on the road with his 17-year-old girlfriend, dropping acid at Disneyland, living in a car, and crashing with armed Black Panthers at the infamous 1968 Democratic National Convention, to hanging out at Max's Kansas City, shooting heroin and cocaine with the likes of rock star Johnny Thunders, and frequenting Times Square's seedy brothels\u2015a journey that mirrored the changing times as the optimism of the '60s gave way to the nihilism of the punk years. Over a dozen years, Bruce crossed paths with hippies, violent cops, rednecks, rock stars, and Black Panthers... and ended up a heroin addict for much of the 1970s. These stories are vividly brought to life in Giraffes in My Hair (A Rock 'N' Roll Life) by the compelling visual storytelling of Bruce's partner, the cartoonist Carol Swain.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Giraffes in My Hair: A Rock 'N' Roll Life"}]}

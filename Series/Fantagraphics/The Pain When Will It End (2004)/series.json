{"metadata": [{"year": "2004", "description": "Tim Kreider's cartoons, previously seen only in the Baltimore City Paper, have attracted a cult following for their razor-sharp intelligence and unprecedented viciousness. His manic, spontaneous line, and his eye for facial expression, gesture, and detail make his cartoons more than one-shot gags. His humor is both erudite and puerile, as personally revealing as a drunken blackout and as politically trenchant as a lone gunman. Kreider's work has been likened to the foul result of inbreeding between Ralph Steadman and B. Kliban. The wide range of subject matter in this collection covers religion and politics to Nietzsche and pie, from sex and violence to the sheer pointlessness of it all.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "The Pain: When Will It End?"}]}

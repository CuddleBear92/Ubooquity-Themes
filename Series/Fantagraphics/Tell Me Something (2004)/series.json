{"metadata": [{"year": "2004", "description": "A blank-eyed, silent meditation on young love thwarted and re-kindled. Tell Me Something picks up the stylized anthropomorphic characters of Jason's earlier works, as well as the challenge of all-pantomime to weave a yarn of young love thwarted and re-kindled. Switching smoothly between two time periods, alternating moments of tenderness and sadness with slapstick and irony, Tell Me Something is a virtuoso technical achievement as well as a funny and sad tale of romance and treachery. \n\n\"Jason's work will haunt you long after you've put it down.\" - AintItCool.com ", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Tell Me Something"}]}

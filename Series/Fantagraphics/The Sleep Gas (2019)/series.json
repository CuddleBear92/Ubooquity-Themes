{"metadata": [{"year": "2019", "description": "Chris Cajero Cilla's new book from FU Press is a collection of the artist's short stories created over the past decade-plus that recall the work of contemporary masters such as Matthew Thurber and Micheal Deforge, as well as the great underground comix of the 1960s and 1970s. Cilla co-mingles styles and genres in the service of surrealist gems such as \"Burp's Law,\" \"Exqueezmeat,\" and \"Labyrinthectomy,\" all of which will buoy you with a blissfully dull buzz long after you've put it down.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "The Sleep Gas"}]}

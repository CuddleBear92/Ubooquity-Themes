{"metadata": [{"year": "2011", "description": "Bill Griffith is best known as the creator of the Zippy daily comic strip, currently running in over 300 newspapers nationwide, but Zippy was conceived as an underground comix character before he became embraced in the mainstream. Beginning in 1969, Griffith contributed stories to a long list of legendary undergrounds. Lost and Found is not only a collection of these underground comix \u2014 hand-picked by the artist himself \u2014 but a mini-memoir of the artist's comix career during the early days of the San Francisco Underground and his nearly twenty year on-again, off-again involvement with Hollywood and TV. This collection from one of the great, pioneering cartoonists also features Griffith's comics for High Times, The National Lampoon, The San Francisco Examiner and The New Yorker.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Lost and Found: Comics 1969-2003"}]}

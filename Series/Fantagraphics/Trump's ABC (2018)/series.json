{"metadata": [{"year": "2018", "description": "One Clinton, two Bushes, and an Obama were mere warm-ups for a President who is truly worthy of Pulitzer-Prize-winner Ann Telnaes's excoriating satirical skills. The election of Donald Trump has inspired Telnaes to chronicles the high points (or low points, if there\u2019s a difference) of Donald Trump\u2019s first six months in office. Written in a sing-songy rhyme and drawn in her beguilingly impeccable ink line, each page is a miniature critique and expose of Donald Trump and his janissaries, poltroons, and dissemblers, illustrating his public policies, his personal defects, his ethical dysfunction, and the consequences of his Presidency on the lives of Americans \u2015 in a format that is cleverly designed to reflect the commander-in-chief \u2019s attention span and mental level.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Fantagraphics", "name": "Trump's ABC"}]}

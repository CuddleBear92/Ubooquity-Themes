With the end of World War II, Ken Takashi is released from an internment camp. Instead of being greeted by a culture that should be ashamed of what it did to so many innocent men and women, he finds himself surrounded by bigots, still quick to dehumanize any Asian it comes across. Frustrated, humilliated, and without many options, he is met by Mr. Moto. He is there to help Ken, many times - but his motives are his own - and he may show Ken that he has much more to lose than he could ever have dreamed!", "name": "Mr. Moto"}]}

It's been 50 years since the strange being from Venus rampaged through Italy. So it has been 50 years of secrets, misinformation, and outright lying. Once the world was convinced that the Ymir was a giant hoax and the mission to Venus never happened, it was lulled back to sleep, ignorant of the truth. But no one counted on genetics. Years of secret testing and breakthroughs in many of the gray areas of science created unintended consequences that could bring the Earth to its knees... and only an 11-year-old child can save it.", "name": "Ray Harryhausen Presents 20 Million Miles More"}]}

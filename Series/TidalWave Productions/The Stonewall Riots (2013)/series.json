This is historically agreed as the catalyst to set forth the gay rights movement.  Facing persecution, prosecution and a violation of their civil rights, the homosexual community was mad as hell and they weren't going to take it any more.  The events at Stonewall lead to riots and demonstrations to open the dialogue and fight for the basic human rights of the homosexual community.  Bluewater Productions is proud to present Stonewall, a detailed account of movement that started with Stonewall and continues to this day with the gay community celebrating gay pride each year to commemorate the brave efforts of the community.", "name": "The Stonewall Riots"}]}

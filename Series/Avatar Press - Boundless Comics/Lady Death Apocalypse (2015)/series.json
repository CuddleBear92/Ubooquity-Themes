{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "The Queen of the Dead is back to life with an all-new series at Boundless!  This super-size #1 features the start of a new fully-painted series from artist Marc Borstel but also has a giant story-so-far to bring all readers up to speed on previous series and make this a perfect place for new readers to start.  Much has changed during Lady Death's absence from the Under Realm, most notably the near-extinction of the warrior class Demons. What devastating effects the demon annihilation will have on the Under Realm remains to be seen, but Hope cannot stand-by idly as a convoy of enslaved demons rolls through the night toward its captives' oblivion. As her plans of rising to power depend on the loyal foot-soldiers she abandoned, now she must rescue them at all cost.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Boundless Comics", "name": "Lady Death: Apocalypse"}]}

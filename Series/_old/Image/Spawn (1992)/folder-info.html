</div>
<div id="desc">While a strange assailant stalks the city, ripping out human hearts, another otherworldly being arrives. As his mind reels, our tortured hero remembers that he struck a deal with the devil in order to return to his beloved wife - five years after his death. The man who was Al Simmons is no more. He has become Spawn. This issue was a wild success selling 1.7 million copies during its launch.

{"metadata": [{"year": "2019", "description": "\"Girls, living in the country will be your chance,\" her parents tell her. And so Catherine Meurisse spends her childhood outdoors. Construction all around her: an old farmhouse renovated into a home, trees planted, a garden created, dreams cultivated. They dig, they graft, they plant a rosebush \"adopted\" from Montaigne, a fig tree from Rabelais. They observe the tumult of the outside world: new developments in industrial agriculture, the citification of rural France... With her characteristic humor, Catherine Meurisse has composed a witty poem dedicated to the countryside where her vocation as an artist first took form. The Great Outdoors, like Lightness, her previous album, is a testament to her conviction that nature and art \u2014everything that grows, everything that lives against all opposition\u2014 always offer us a chance.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Europe Comics", "name": "The Great Outdoors"}]}

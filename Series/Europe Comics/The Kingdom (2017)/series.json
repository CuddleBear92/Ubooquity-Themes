{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "Once upon a time there was a peaceful kingdom where life was good. It was a little country forgotten by its powerful neighbors and their incessant wars. A lovely little piece of land where lived a great many people, and every day they enjoyed the bounties bestowed upon them by the earth and sky. Of course, there was a king, Alain and Adrien (his ugly sons who were nonetheless kind, helpful boys), a grumpy queen, C\u00e9cile (the bathroom-hogging princess), and Anne. Pretty little Anne. Anne, who sings to the rising sun; Anne, who lights up the king's nights; Anne, who speaks to the birds... Anne who opens a tavern where all these characters gather.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Europe Comics", "name": "The Kingdom"}]}

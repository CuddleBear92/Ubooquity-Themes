{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "Usually around about the 40 mark, the human male has a habit of leaving his well-worn spouse in search of greener pastures. As they say, the grass is always greener on the other side. Florence Cestac dissects this subject of common interest, from the very first symptoms right up to the final outbreak, via the pangs of \"bathrobe-sofa\" depression. \"You're the love of my life! But with her, it's something else... she's a fairy,\" declares our hero with the touching honesty of a male en route to adventure. So once our hero's skipped off into the sunset with his fairy, our heroine begins asking herself a series of counter-productive questions regarding her general attitude and in particular her cellulite. She then 1). Discovers that everyone else knew about it all along 2). Listens to the questionable opinions of her girlfriends 3). Attempts to rekindle old flames dug out of her old phone book and to kindle new ones in her local DIY store. She explains to her kid that Daddy \"just took a little jaunt over to Mars,\" which the kid in turn interprets as \"Daddy flew to Mars with a slut that Mommy doesn't like.\" She manages to raise her spirits with \"tiptopform,\" drinks a bit, weeps a lot, and buries the dog who decided to die right in the middle of it all - cherry on the cake. Anyway, she \"handles it\" and she survives. Between giggles and anguish, this will touch anyone who's ever felt the sting of that wonderful thing we call love. Disarmingly frank, with endearingly crude humor and a perfect understanding of her subject, this is Florence Cestac on top form.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Europe Comics", "name": "The Midlife Crisis"}]}

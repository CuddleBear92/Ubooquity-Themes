But the road to the Tour de France is more challenging and dangerous than he thought, and a terrible accident leaves him handicapped. Still, Am\u00e9d\u00e9e remains undaunted and trains even harder, which sets him on the road to cycling stardom... until war breaks out and interrupts his plans yet again.

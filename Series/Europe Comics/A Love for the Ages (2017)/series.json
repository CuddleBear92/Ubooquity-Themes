{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "Jean and Germaine are the most affable couple the little village of Colle sur Loup has ever seen. A duke married to a commoner, they have no children, no jobs, and are disastrous cooks! They like to indulge in life's small pleasures; their books, their garden, and their after-lunch naps. They live for each other, and for their love. Their simple happiness intrigues, fascinates, infuriates and is the envy of all those around them.\n\nDaniel Pennac knew Jean and Germaine well. He spent his time at their house reading, watching, learning, and, of course, trying Germaine's catastrophic efforts in the kitchen! He's now taken it upon himself to tell the story of those happy days, and of a love that has always captivated him.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Europe Comics", "name": "A Love for the Ages"}]}

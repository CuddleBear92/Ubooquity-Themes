Usually a model student, the seventh grader has got himself in trouble with a couple of bullies from the Free German Youth, and the only person who can help is the mysterious new kid in school... Vivid and funny, tender and nuanced, \"Kinderland\" chronicles East Germany's final months as seen through the eyes of a child. It's a story of friendship, courage, and trust, but also of growing up between Young Pioneers and the church, fathers who \"disappear,\" and a ping-pong tournament interrupted by the fall of the Berlin Wall. Winner of the Max & Moritz Award for Best Comic at the 2014 Erlangen International Comics Festival.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Europe Comics", "name": "Kinderland"}]}

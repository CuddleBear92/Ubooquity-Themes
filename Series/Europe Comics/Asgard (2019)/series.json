All hope seems lost until a stranger with a dark past and a score to settle with the gods shows up and offers to hunt down and slay the Kr\u00f6kken for a thousand silver talents. Soon a ragtag group of would-be monster hunters boards a drak and, against a divine, ominous Nordic background of lakes and mist and mountains, sets sail on a perilous mission not all will survive.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Europe Comics", "name": "Asgard"}]}

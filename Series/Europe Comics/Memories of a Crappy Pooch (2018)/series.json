{"metadata": [{"year": "2018", "description": "Maria Fuencisla, a long-term resident in a central Madrid neighborhood, is hit hard when her pet dies in a tragic accident. Her three best friends, Anastasia, Dori and Ricarda, come up with various schemes to try to comfort her, but it's almost impossible, because the deceased dog was the focus of the old lady's entire universe. These pages are full of tragicomic memories showing us how Maria Fuencisla and her small dog formed such a solid \u2014 if somewhat unorthodox \u2014 team. Together, they overcome the difficulties of being a senior citizen and a puppy in this hyper-modern age. The puppy was her dearest one, the son that she never had, and as she thinks back on their adventures together, she tries to move past this latest tragedy and move on with her life... but the fates have more in store for her.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Europe Comics", "name": "Memories of a Crappy Pooch"}]}

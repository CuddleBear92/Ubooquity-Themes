Generally mediocre, a poor student, awkward with girls... he's a walking disaster. But Louca has decided: starting tomorrow, he's going to change! Still, that's easier said than done... especially when your own mind keeps changing! Luckily, Louca will get a helping hand from a certain fellow named Nathan. Good-looking, amazing at football, funny, smart... this Nathan certainly seems like the perfect guy, and the best coach Louca could possibly hope for. With one little exception: Nathan is a ghost... How did Nathan die? Why can only Louca see him? Will Nathan manage to turn Louca into the kind of guy people want to be with? Will Louca manage both to pass his exams, and to win over Julie, the girl of his dreams?", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Europe Comics", "name": "Louca"}]}

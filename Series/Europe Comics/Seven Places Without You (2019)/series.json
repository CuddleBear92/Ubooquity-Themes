Jorge has been spending less and less time at home. Elena isn't sure what to make of his absence. and one day. she decides to leave. \"Seven Places Without You\" is the story of a young couple's first experience of a relationship on the rocks; a story that allows time to elapse and silences to lengthen. focusing more on how events develop than on the events themselves. It's also the story of the spaces where these events occur: the seven places of the title. and of Jorge's absence.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Europe Comics", "name": "Seven Places Without You"}]}

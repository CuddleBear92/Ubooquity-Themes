{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "This is a collection of portraits of 7 women, of all different ages, backgrounds, circumstances and eras. Each one of them is facing a defining moment in her life. They are bound together by the symbol of their femininity: their breasts. We see an awkward college girl getting to grips with her womanhood; a 1960s house-wife freeing herself from the restraints of propriety; the manager of a small underwear shop fighting against corporate giants; a woman nude modeling for an unexpected reason... Love, illness, sex, liberation, sensuality: Olivier Pont draws us into the lives of these women with astounding force.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Europe Comics", "name": "Fragments of Femininity"}]}

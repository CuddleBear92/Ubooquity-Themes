In a chilling and clever tour de force, the authors use the backdrop of the 1910 Great Flood of Paris to depict a world where animals rule and humans are viewed as curiosities, scientific guinea pigs, hunting trophies, and the occasional snack. A political satire that forces us to question our treatment of different species, the nature of\u00a0intelligence, and more.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Europe Comics", "name": "Alas"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "Modern-day Paris. One night, as she's leaving rehearsal, Lola, a young dancer, is approached by Ren\u00e9e. She introduces herself as a writer, and asks Lola if she could share her life for a while in order to gather material to write a book about her. Despite not feeling entirely comfortable with the idea, Lola accepts. The very next day, Lola and Ren\u00e9e experience the strangest day of their lives, involving an absent father who reappears at random points throughout the book, a bashful but psychopathic admirer, Omar Shariff, and a huge spider... All this is set against a backdrop of a general power cut, a highly demanding dance class and a very rainy day. In the world of today, where everything goes too quickly, twenty-four hours is sometimes enough to change your life.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Europe Comics", "name": "Modern Speed"}]}

The son of a powerful family from the capital, Managua, Gabriel is a young priest with an incredible talent for sacred art. He is sent to enhance his painting skills with Ruben, a priest in San Juan--a little village located at the base of a mountain. Despite his difficulty integrating with the villagers due to his father's reputation, Gabriel slowly gets to know them and, eventually, to love them. Encouraged by Ruben, he paints the villagers. He paints them as they are--men and women of flesh and blood. But Gabriel is soon witness to acts of military repression of the locals. It doesn't take long for him and the villagers to get swept away in these times of growing rebellion and smoldering revolution. Artistic passion, romantic passion, revolutionary passion. Passion courses though the pages of Muchacho, a two-part series. Here is part one.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Europe Comics", "name": "Muchacho"}]}

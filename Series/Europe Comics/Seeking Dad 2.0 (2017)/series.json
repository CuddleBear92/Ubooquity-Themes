To help her cope with the difficulties she faces as such in her personal and professional life, she's a regular at the M.A (mothers anonymous) association, a conversation group for women who are a little overwhelmed by their motherhood. Caroline shares her tragi-comic attempts to find love and companionship, while Philippe, a slightly out-of-place new arrival at M.A., reflects on his status as a 'dad 2.0'. A funny, intelligent, and moving graphic novel, a touch of chick lit with a feminist twist that comments on one of the big social subjects of our time: the new family model.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Europe Comics", "name": "Seeking: Dad 2.0"}]}

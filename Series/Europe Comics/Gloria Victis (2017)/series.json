{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "There was a time when certain mortals could become gods. At this time, two thousand years ago, men would pass into legend by risking their lives to entertain the crowds; famous charioteers who, perched on their chariots like Apollo, would fight for their lives and their honor in the arena. This is the story of one of those heroes: Aelio Hermeros, perhaps one of the greates chariot riders of all time.

Here he meets some stray people who call themselves \"La Banda del Sole Felino\". The new friends convince her to escape and become a free cat. But if the raids in the woods make Brina aware of a lifestyle and an emancipation that she did not know, on the other hand they will panic the two young masters, who do not accept to lose what for them is a fundamental component of the family. Dedicating a sophisticated attention to human and feline sentiments, Cornia and Salati, affirmed by Disney author, manage to frame the issue of the difficult balance between protecting those we love and allowing them the freedom to make mistakes, and get away with their own resources.

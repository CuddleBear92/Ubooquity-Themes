{"metadata": [{"year": "2019", "description": "When his past caught up with him in South America, Tango took care of the situation and made a new friend along the way, Mario. The two men leave the desert behind for the open sea, but when Mario grows bored sailing around the Caribbean, they stop on the tiny island where Tango's grandfather lives. What should have been a nice family visit, however, quickly turns into a violent confrontation. Trouble has a way of finding him (or is it the other way around?), but Tango's got a knack for getting out of it. He may be an outlaw, but his sense of justice is sharp. Comfort and convenience are tossed to the wind when it's time for Tango to protect the ones he loves.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Europe Comics", "name": "Tango"}]}

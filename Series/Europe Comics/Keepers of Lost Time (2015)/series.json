The first episode was published in 1990, the second in 2000, but it wasn't until 2012 that the trilogy finally saw its highly anticipated conclusion, published by Darkwood. This future-fantasy comic depicts two cultures \u2013 one of high technology, the other \u2013 tribal, in moments of their internal crises. They exist synchronously and interdependently, yet are in conflict due to their vastly different perceptions of the world and spiritual values.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Europe Comics", "name": "Keepers of Lost Time"}]}

The highly contagious virus turns people into seemingly mindless creatures, monstrous in appearance and inhumanly strong when provoked.

To survive, they must fight bloodthirsty militias and infected creatures alike, as they hold out hope they can find a cure for their friend, before he becomes a menace to them all.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Europe Comics", "name": "Green Class"}]}

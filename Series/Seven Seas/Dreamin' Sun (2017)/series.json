The first condition is that Kameko tell him why she ran away from home. The second is that she fetch the stranger's lost apartment key (he is locked out!). The third condition is... to have a dream. Kameko meets the conditions, moves in, and begins a journey of romance and self-discovery.", "name": "Dreamin' Sun"}]}

From long, graceful elvish ears, to burly dwarven muscles, or an oni's horns, you never quite know who, or what, you'll see walking down the street these days. However, none of these individuals are born with the inherent traits their species are known for, and no one is more painfully aware of this than Kazamori. Born with the appearance of an elf, everyone expects her to wield magic, but she just can't do it! Kazamori has managed to hide this fact until now, but when an ordinary human who can use his own science-based version of magic learns the truth about her, what's a young elf girl in high school to do?", "name": "Species Domain"}]}

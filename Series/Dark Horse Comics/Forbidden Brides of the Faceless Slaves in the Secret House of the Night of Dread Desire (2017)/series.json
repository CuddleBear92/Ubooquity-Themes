{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "A celebrated send-up of gothic literature, beautifully adapted into a dark, brooding, and oddly comical graphic novel. Somewhere in the night, a raven caws, an author's pen scratches, and thunder claps. The author wants to write nonfiction: stories about frail women in white nightgowns, mysterious bumps in the night, and the undead rising to collect old debts. But he keeps getting interrupted by the everyday annoyances of talking ravens, duels to the death, and his sinister butler. Shane Oakley beautifully illustrates New York Times best-selling author Neil Gaiman's satirical tale. \"It's about what fantasy is, and why we write it, and what it would mean to write fantasy if you lived in a Gothic universe.\" - Neil Gaiman\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dark Horse", "name": "Forbidden Brides of the Faceless Slaves in the Secret House of the Night of Dread Desire"}]}

Featuring an unfathomable number of lines which have been hand chiseled into inked clay, this labor of love by Nicholas Gurewitch invokes the morbid humor of his comic strip (The Perry Bible Fellowship) and the spooky silent-film qualities of the late Edward Gorey.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dark Horse", "name": "Notes on a Case of Melancholia, or: A Little Death"}]}

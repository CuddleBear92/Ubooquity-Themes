Over seven feet tall and weighing over a thousand pounds, he is known as Concrete but is in reality the mind of one Ronald Lithgow, trapped inside a shell of stone, a body that allows him to walk unaided on the ocean's floor or survive the crush of a thousand tons of rubble in a collapsed mineshaft...but prevents him from feeling the touch of a human hand.\n\nThese stories of Concrete are as rich and satisfying as any in comics: funny, heartbreaking, and singularly human. Depths, the first in a series of collections reprinting the classic early Concrete stories along with never-before-collected short stories, includes the Eisner-nominated \"Orange Glow\" and \"Vagabond,\" Paul Chadwick's autobiographical account of a cross-country hitchhiking trip.\n\n\u2022 \"Probably the best comic being published today by anyone, anywhere.\",Harlan Ellison\n\n\u2022 Paul Chadwick's Concrete has won five Eisner Awards and three Harvey Awards.\n\n\u2022 One of GQ's \"20 Graphic Novels You Should Read.\"", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dark Horse", "name": "Concrete"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2016", "description": "This hardcover retelling of the Commedia dell'arte legend of hopeless, fawning love updates the relationship of buffoonish Harlequin and his sensible, oblivious Columbine. Consumed with love, the impulsive clown gives his heart freely, only to see it dragged about town, with a charming surprise to bend the tale in a modern direction. Spending a cold Valentine's Day alone can be hard to swallow, but Neil Gaiman (Coraline, Newbery Medal winner The Graveyard Book) and John Bolton (The Evil Dead) want you to know that all it takes is a steak knife, a fork, and a bottle of quality ketchup . . . Finally back in print!\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dark Horse", "name": "Harlequin Valentine"}]}

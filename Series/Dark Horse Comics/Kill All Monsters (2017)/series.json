{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "Monsters rule the world. Humanity's last hope is a squad of giant robots and their skilled pilots, all from different backgrounds, each with a unique reason to fight. Can we survive the conflict? Are we worth saving? A familiar but wholly original story about war, survival, and the human spirit, told through gigantic-scale battles fought by memorable characters! Contains over 100 pages of new story, in addition to collecting the entire hit webcomic!\n\n\"Although May gives us plenty of giant monster-killing, he's smart enough to make sure that there's a reason we care that the robots are fighting the monsters rather than just saying \"Hey, robots fighting monsters is cool, right?\" \n-comicbookresources.com\n\n\"May and Copland have engaged in some pretty cool world-building, taking the basic idea and running with it until they have something special that goes way beyond what you might expect from \"another giant monster title.\" -Robot6\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dark Horse", "name": "Kill All Monsters"}]}

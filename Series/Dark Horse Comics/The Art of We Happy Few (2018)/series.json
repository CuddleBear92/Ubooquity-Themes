Two-hundred pages of mind-bending art and insightful creator commentary exploring the conceptualization and execution of We Happy Few!\n\nOctober, 1964. The City of Wellington Wells is all that's left of England after the German invasion and four years of occupation.

Showcasing a unique retro-futuristic style, this book includes hundreds of pieces of concept art, paired with exclusive commentary from the team that created it!

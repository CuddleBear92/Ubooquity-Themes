{"metadata": [{"year": "2018", "description": "In this follow-up to the 2008 art book Robots and Donuts, vintage toys are paired with pastries to create fascinatingly bizarre paintings.\n\nThis volume showcases San Francisco-based artist Eric Joyner's newest and most impressive pieces--including The Horseshoe Bend, Daybreak, Movers and Shakers, and more. Much like the subjects of his paintings, Joyner's artistic style is subtly nostalgic yet imaginatively unique. By juxtaposing familiar items with every day foods, he creates whimsical masterpieces that have the power to both comfort and inspire. Robotic Existentialism: The Art of Eric Joyner is a beautiful collection that entices the reader to stop, ponder the meaning of life, and perhaps savor a donut or two.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dark Horse", "name": "The Art of Eric Joyner"}]}

Now we have the Play of the Gods--a tale of lust for gold, lust for power, and lust for cheese dip. As with all things Groo, it's brought to you by the award-winning team of Sergio Aragon\u00e9s, ably assisted by the lettering of Stan Sakai and the coloring of Tom Luth. The Gods themselves watch this story from the above so it must be good enough for you. This handsome paperback volume collects all four issues of the series: in one package, you get a lot of Groo doing real stupid things and causing mass destruction. Just what you wanted!\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dark Horse", "name": "Groo: Play of the Gods"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2013", "description": "Forty years ago, a group of superhumans emerged in San Francisco, guided by a man whose unique new drugs gave them incredible powers. For five generations, they've stood for the rights of freedom and safety, and invited other like-minded individuals of sound mind and unflinching dedication to stand with them. To these young men and women, they ask, \"How much do you want to be a superhuman?\" One young man, obsessed with the need for street justice, wants it badly... perhaps even enough to bring on the last days of an American legend. See, the team is not the only thing that's advanced over the years, and there are no easy victories once their luck finally runs out. A revolution in masked heroes by Warren Ellis, the award-winning creator of TRANSMETROPOLITAN and PLANETARY.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Avatar", "name": "No Hero"}]}

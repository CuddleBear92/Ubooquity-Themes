{"metadata": [{"year": "2014", "description": "Master storyteller GARTH ENNIS and Fashion Beast artist FACUNDO PERCIO team up to deliver a haunting new epic of science fiction horror.  The crew of the Caliban travels  hyperspace on nothing more than a routine trip for the giant vessel.  Just human beings that have been inside a bit too long, confident of no other life in the Galaxy, and all the vastness of space to remind them how far they are from home.  But when an impossible accident suddenly causes the Caliban to slam into an abandoned alien ship, a nightmare in space begins to unfold.   Ennis delivers his unique brand of flawed characters, spot-on dialog, and trademark flare for the unexpected in a new series in the vein of Alien. \n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Avatar", "name": "Caliban"}]}

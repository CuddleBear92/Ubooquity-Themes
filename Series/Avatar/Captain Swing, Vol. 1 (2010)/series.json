{"metadata": [{"year": "2010", "description": "From the sparking-mad mind of Warren Ellis, the creator of AETHERIC MECHANICS and DOKTOR SLEEPLESS, comes an electrical romance of a pirate utopia thwarted: CAPTAIN SWING & THE ELECTRICAL PIRATES OF CINDERY ISLAND. This crackling mini-series is illustrated in Raulo Caceres' stunning woodcut style, and presented in full color. London, 1830: newly-minted copper Charlie Gravel keeps seeing things he's not supposed to. A crooked Bow Street Runner with a flintlock revolver, flying things that are not supposed to fly, and the violent Scientific Phantasmagoria that is christened Spring-Heeled Jack, but is known by other names. It is the time of Captain Swing and his Electrical Pirates, and history will never be the same.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Avatar", "name": "Captain Swing, Vol. 1"}]}

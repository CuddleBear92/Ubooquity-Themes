{"metadata": [{"year": "2007", "description": "Garth Ennis unleashes his next major religious epic in the vein of Preacher, but this-time, he's taking it up a notch! Wormwood is the anti-Christ, no way around it, his dad is Satan and his demonic powers help him fit right into New York. His best friend is Jesus, who is a black, mentally-challenged, man that just isn't performing many miracles these days. The pesky Armageddon is coming right up, and it doesn't look like Pope Jacko is going to be any help in stopping it. Ennis drags the whole world into the gutter with his trademark razor-sharp dialogue, biting wit, and the stunning art of Jacen Burrows, all in full-color.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Avatar", "name": "Chronicles of Wormwood"}]}

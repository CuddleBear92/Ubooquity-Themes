{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "Welcome to Vermintown! Nobody gives a crap about the little people any more. Once they were the mainstay of folklore: goblins, leprechauns, pixies, and fey. But now? Dispossessed, forgotten, doubting even their own traditions, they've trickled into Vermintown: a vast and vile city of a million inch-tall malcontents. Sprawling through an abandoned subway station deep beneath London, here myth has given way to sleaze, drugs, gangland violence, and interracial hatred. Vermintown is where magic went to die. What ever happened to magic? Disenchanted answers that question with all the ugliness of the fairy slums in this first chapter of the collected webseries.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Avatar", "name": "Disenchanted"}]}

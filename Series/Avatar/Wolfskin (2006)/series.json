{"metadata": [{"year": "2006", "description": "From the time before history began: from the time when the continents were still connected by land: from the harsh climes at the top of the world, a Northish soldier wrapped in a cape of wolfpelts walks south, into the forests of the High Midlands that are now Europe, to find a village cut in two by travelers from the East. Soon, he too is torn - between duty to the lives he has ruined just by finding them, and duty to the hideous murder-god of the Northish wastes and the berserker drugs that are his sacrament... Warren Ellis cuts loose to unleash his take on the genre fans demanded he assault with full color art from Juan Jose Ryp! WOLFSKIN fuses heroic fantasy in the mode of CONAN, the Viking sagas, and samurai fiction into a single story of weird history and apocalyptic violence.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Avatar", "name": "Wolfskin"}]}

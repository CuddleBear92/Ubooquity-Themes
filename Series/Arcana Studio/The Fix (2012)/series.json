{"metadata": [{"year": "2012", "description": "83 pages!\nAn undercover cop (Victor Campbell) enters an old warehouse to meet with \"The Fixer\", the muscle bound vigilante who has been independently and aggressively taking drug dealers off the streets. Victor is shocked by what he sees in the warehouse office, a former fellow SWAT officer (Kent Dawning) who had been assumed dead for over five years. But not only is Kent alive, he is the Fixer. Kent, who looks nothing like his former self, now looking more like a tweaked out drug addict tells the story of how he became fixer for the first time and how it has consumed him to the point where normal life is no longer a option to him. On a botched drug bust in a spectacular and bloody fight, Kent is injected with a experimental new narcotic (Hyperdrenaline) that transforms him into the Fixer who has far above average strength and feels no pain whatsoever, once the drug wears off all the pain rushes back to him like it just happened all at once.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Arcana Comics", "name": "The Fix"}]}

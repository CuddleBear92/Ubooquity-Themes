Stories about him were told in whispers, if at all. Now the legendary creative team of Garth Ennis and Goran Parlov brings the first of those stories to light: the tale of Frank Castle\u2019s first command, and his first kill. During the Tet Offensive, death surrounded Lt. Castle\u2019s platoon on all sides. How far would Frank go to protect his men? Especially when the danger came from the indifference of his commanders? And while Castle was engaged in the grind of war, a kindred spirit on the enemy\u2019s side watched\u2026and waited. It\u2019s a seemingly hopeless mission. It\u2019s Lt. Castle\u2019s first platoon. It\u2019s the answer to the question: What made the Punisher?\n", "name": "Punisher: The Platoon"}]}

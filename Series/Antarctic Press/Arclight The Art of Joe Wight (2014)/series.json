{"metadata": [{"year": "2014", "description": "Antarctic Press is proud to present an artwork showcase of one of the most amazing comic book artists of our time: Joseph Wight.  One of the very first (if not THE first) artist to do painted art in Photoshop (Shotgun Mary, 1995), Joe's gorgeous rendering (color and grayscale), narrative timing (comic, dramatic, and horror) and near-fanatical precision in rendering machines (real and fictional) on land and sea and air have graced titles for numerous companies since 1989.  From Twilight X to Nazi Zombies, from Star Wars: The Manga to First Moon, Joe's work has garnered him international praise from peers and fans alike, earning him a signing trip to Europe, limited print commissions for military groups, and more.  Now the man Adam Warren calls the \"Photoshop Monster,\" has assembled a choice selection of his art pieces, presented in FULL COLOR in DIGITAL.  This will make a proud addition for any collector of fine art or fan of military, zombies, humor, action, gorgeous women, jaw-dropping scenery... well, you get the idea.

{"metadata": [{"year": "2013", "description": "Specially formatted digital edition! Berkeley Breathed, the mad genius who boggled and bewildered us with \"Bloom County\", is back! Soon after retiring \"Bloom County\" - and at the peak of its popularity - Breathed returned with an all-new Sunday-only newspaper strip: \"Outland\". Debuting just four weeks after the final \"Bloom County\" was published, and with many of the same cast members, \"Outland\" continues on in the same traditions set forth by its forebears - ranging from delightful whimsy to raging satire! This volume contains every \"Outland\" strip published, some never-before-collected in book form, and nearly all have been scanned from the original art, provided by Breathed from his personal archives. It includes more than 280 Sunday pages, all in fully remastered color, from September 3, 1989 through March 26, 1995.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "IDW", "name": "Berkeley Breathed's Outland"}]}

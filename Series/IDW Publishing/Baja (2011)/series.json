{"metadata": [{"year": "2011", "description": "Illustrator Nathan St John and writer Ben Wagner bring modern noir to the West in the original graphic novel BAJA. In this sexy, twisting thriller, Hil and Zack-- a beautiful woman and a man who knows better-- must escape a stalker whose fate is tied to their own. St John and Wagner play with conventions, leading readers in unexpected directions with a story that deftly weaves two tales of love, sex, greed, and betrayal. St John's distinctive art style perfectly matches the shadowy criminal world of BAJA.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "IDW", "name": "Baja"}]}

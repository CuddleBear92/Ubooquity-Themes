It's a rollercoaster of death and absolution, drenched in atmosphere and action in three stories focused on the Dinobots. First, in \"Punishment,\" Optimus Prime and Windblade team up to stop a killer, but do they really want to, when all the victims are Decepticons? Then, in the title story, the Dinobots accept a dangerous mission into the Cybertronian wilds, but they get more than they bargained for, and are forced to reassess their beliefs in the process. Finally, in \"Salvation,\" the Dinobots are reviled for the things they've done. So when their greatest threat, Trypticon, appears, how much will they sacrifice for a world that hates them?\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "IDW", "name": "Transformers: Redemption of the Dinobots"}]}

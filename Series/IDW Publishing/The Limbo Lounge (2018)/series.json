{"metadata": [{"year": "2018", "description": "An original graphic novel where newly dead people in Limbo await their fate at a bar while surrounded by bored interlopers from hell. This trippy, surreal, full-color adventure brings us from the hot, swirling sands of hell to the colorfully bizarre Limbo Lounge. Meet flower-headed freaks, Bud and Lou. Root for their new friend, a spry, elderly nun, Sister Eunice, as she works remotely in Limbo continuing to rid earth of despicable dirt bags. And, by all means, avoid the knife-wielding little pageant-princess-gone-bad as she plots for anything she can get at anyone's expense. The Limbo Lounge is the auspicious debut of a line of Yoe Books graphic novels.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "IDW", "name": "The Limbo Lounge"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2018", "description": "Like the best rock n' roll bands, Love Song is four parts that harmonize the muddy and messy chords of life into a breathtaking resolution. United by a shared love of music, this collection of four \"albums\" is composed of a series of short stories, each running into the next like best cuts from your favorite records. And like a classic album, Love Song gets the joy and humor out of the way up front, letting the story wind its way into the dark and serious corners of adult life. Alternating between loud and quiet or hard and soft, this story will sink its hook into readers like a jingle or riff that just won't be easily forgotten.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "IDW", "name": "Love Song"}]}

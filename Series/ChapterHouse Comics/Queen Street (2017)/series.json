{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "Meet Aimee, an overworked junior partner at a prestigious law firm in Manila. One storybook romance, four back-to-back flights, and nine years later, in the small of mind but big in spirit town, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, she now lives; still overworked. But as a lower class serial-full-timer and mother to her only child, Melodie, an intelligent and eccentric seven-year-old, whose big personality is only rivalled by her even bigger imagination. Join them and a cast of unlikely characters just as confused and lost, as they stumble blindly for twelve consecutive hours through the beautifully disastrous comedy of Life. Don't miss this breakout semi-autobiographical slice of life tale from Emmanuelle Chateauneuf.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "ChapterHouse Comics", "name": "Queen Street"}]}

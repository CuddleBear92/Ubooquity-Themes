{"metadata": [{"year": "2018", "description": "Brooklyn Gladiator is set in the year 2033, in a despoiled America where New Yorkers survive on scraps. John Miller is an action hero for the ages, a rough and ready badass who could drink Han Solo, Jack Burton, and John McClane under the table. Brooklyn Gladiator is a tribute to the comics, films, and experiences that have inspired author Dan Fogler. With artwork from Glen Fabry, Tom Hodges, and Darrick Robertson, a panoramic creative vision, and a bloodthirsty, snarling sense of humor, this a comic sure to leave mind-blown readers in its wake!", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "ChapterHouse Comics", "name": "Brooklyn Gladiator"}]}

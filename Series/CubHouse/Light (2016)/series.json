On the way, they carry fire-lit torches through secret places and endless passages, swim in crystal-clear waters, encounter strange beasts and creatures, and meet strange mysterious hermits! Writer/artist Rob Cham creates beautiful, vivid illustrations that gradually evolve from black and white subterranean worlds to vivid bright colorscapes. This inspiring, all-ages story recalls retro video-game vibes and role-playing games, creating a one-of-a-kind mythos of magic lands and mischievous critters.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "CubHouse", "name": "Light"}]}

But for Henni? Not so much.\n\nIn the original graphic novel HENNI, Manhattan-based writer/artist Miss Lasko Gross presents the adventures and trials of Henni, a rebellious and curious young woman who questions authority, challenges the ways of her strict religion and strikes out on her own in search of a better life. The boutique graphic novel publisher Z2 will publish HENNI, introducing readers to a unique and distinctive character--and a creative vision that channels Maurice Sendak and Lynda Barry.\n\nHenni embarks on what Lakso-Gross calls \"a rare adventure story where violence isn't the method to resolution and success. This is a fable about faith where faith--or a new system of spirituality--doesn't solve the world's problems.\" HENNI is a coming of age tale that, like the main character, refuses easy answers.", "name": "Henni"}]}

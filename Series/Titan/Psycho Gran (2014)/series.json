David is also the co-creator of cult 1990's strip The Driver for British comic Toxic!\n\nPsycho Gran (or Psycho Besta as she's known in Norway) is a five-foot high, mauve-haired, bespectacled, psychotic granny with a pan-dimensional, sentient handbag called Percy, a flying dog called Archie and a pathological loathing of rudeness. \n\nJoin her for an all-new, 29-page, full-color journey into a surrealist slapstick world of rampaging kaiju, neo-Nazi skinheads, bag-snatchers, death-row inmates, explosive diarrhoea and those annoying SOBs who will insist on using their bloody cellphones in cinemas.\n\nShe puts the Old into Old Skool Kicking! \n\n\"While old comedy comic characters wither in the creaking care home of bad stewardship, David Leach's old but un-withered, bad, batty, toothless, ruthless, fearless, frightening, horrible, hilarious, Psycho Gran marches on in her surgical stockings, getting stronger by the day. Bless him!\"\n - David Lloyd, artist and co-creator of V For Vendetta.", "name": "Psycho Gran"}]}

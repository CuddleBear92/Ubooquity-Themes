The surprising flood of victims overwhelms neighboring countries, and chaos follows. Resentment in host nations heightens as disruption and the cost of aid grows.

Shining a light on the stories of the survivors, The Unwanted is a testament to the courage and resilience of the refugees and a call to action for all those who read.\"", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "name": "The Unwanted: Graphic Novel"}]}

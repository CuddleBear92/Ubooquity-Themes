{"metadata": [{"year": "2019", "description": "A beautiful graphic adaptation of George Orwell's timeless and timely allegorical novel.\n\n\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\"\n\nIn 1945, George Orwell, called \"the conscience of his generation,\" created an enduring, devastating story of new tyranny replacing old, and power corrupting even the noblest of causes. Today it is all too clear that Orwell's masterpiece is still fiercely relevant wherever cults of personality thrive, truths are twisted by those in power, and freedom is under attack. Now, in this fully authorized edition, the artist Odyr translates the world and message of Animal Farm into a gorgeously imagined graphic novel.\n\nOld Major, Napoleon, Squealer, Snowball, Boxer, and all the animals of Animal Farm come to life in this newly envisaged classic. From his individual brushstrokes to the freedom of his page design, Odyr's adaptation seamlessly moves between satire and fable and will appeal to all ages, just as Orwell intended.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "name": "Animal Farm: The Graphic Novel"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2018", "description": "Ariel Schrag, a critically-acclaimed memoirist and screenwriter, takes us on a painfully funny tour of her formative years, from her childhood in Berkeley to her mid-twenties in Brooklyn, exploring what it means to connect to others when you don't yet know who you are\u2014when you want to be \"part of it\" but the \"it\" changes daily. We meet hippie babysitters, mean girls, best friends, former friends, prom dates, girlfriends, sex ed students, and far too many LensCrafters sales associates.\n\nThese frank, irreverent, and honest comics revel in the uncomfortable\u2014occasionally cringe-inducing\u2014moments from our early years that end up wiring us as people. Part of It further cements Ariel Schrag as \"one of the best pure storytellers...in any medium\" (Comics Journal).", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "name": "Part of It"}]}

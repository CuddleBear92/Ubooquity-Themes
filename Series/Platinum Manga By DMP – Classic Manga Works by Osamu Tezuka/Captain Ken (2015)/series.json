In a whirlwind of gunfights, horseback chases, and utter lawlessness, Captain Ken sparks a time of change. The townspeople seek to rid themselves of the corrupt Mayor Deven (who doesn't give a whit about anyone else), and the Martians wish to reclaim the cities that were once their homes. Stranded in a prison full of enslaved Martians, Ken must get himself out, or all is lost.\n", "name": "Captain Ken"}]}

{"metadata": [{"name": "Country Ass-Whuppin'", "year": "2012", "description": "On April 27, 2011 a string of deadly tornadoes ripped across the southeastern United States, with the brunt of the devastation focused on the state of Alabama. In an effort to help the many victims still putting their lives back together, some of the finest comic creators working in the industry today, many with roots or ties to the south, have banded together and donated their time for a uniquely southern anthology: COUNTRY ASS-WHUPPIN'. \n\nThe stories have one thing in common-- they are all about people in the south kickin' ass or getting their ass kicked! Enjoy both tall-tales and true stories, told by some of the best in the business; including Jason Aaron (X-MEN), Sean Patrick Flanery (BOONDOCK SAINTS), Rebekah Isaacs (ANGEL & FAITH), Nathan Edmondson (THE ACTIVITY) and many more. Don't miss this celebration of southern culture, while having fun and helping those in need.\n\n100% of the proceeds from this book will be donated to the 'Governor's Emergency Relief Fund' which goes directly to the Alabama tornado victims who are still in need.

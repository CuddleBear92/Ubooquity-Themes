{"metadata": [{"name": "The Ride", "year": "2005", "description": "As the flagship title of the 12-Gauge line, THE RIDE was conceived to be--both literally and figuratively--a \"vehicle\" for some of the comics industry's leading talent to spread their wings. That \"vehicle\" is a 1968 Camaro, the unifying element through these stories of bullets, babes, murder, and mayhem. \n\nIssue #1 contains the first two action-packed chapters of a four-part story, illustrated by industry legends CULLY HAMNER (RED) and BRIAN STELFREEZE (BATMAN), written by DOUG WAGNER (ICE), and a cover by ADAM HUGHES (WONDER WOMAN).", "publisher": "12 Gauge", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

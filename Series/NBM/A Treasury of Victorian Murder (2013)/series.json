Rick has researched this book extensively and presents, with his own inimitable tongue-in-cheek style, the Jack The Ripper mystery as told through a journal of a fascinated Englishman of the day. Both factual and darkly funny, Geary's personal take on this story shines an ironic light on the repressive society that spawned such a monster. \n\n\"Geary's haunting drawings unite seamlessly with his moody, well-researched text.\" --Publishers Weekly\n\n\"Expertly designed and drawn.\" --Ellery Queen", "name": "A Treasury of Victorian Murder"}]}

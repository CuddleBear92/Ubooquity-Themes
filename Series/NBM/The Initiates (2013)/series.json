He doesn't know much about the world of wine-making.\nRichard Leroy is a wine-maker. He's rarely even read comics. But these two are full of good will and curiosity. Why do we choose to spend one's life writing and creating comics or producing wine? For more than a year, Etienne went to work in Richard's vineyards and cellar. Richard, in return, leapt into the world of comics. They opened a lot of bottles and read many comics. They traveled around, meeting authors and wine-makers sharing their passion for their jobs. The Initiates explores the nature of a man's vocation with a true life representation of it from two very different perspectives. ", "name": "The Initiates"}]}

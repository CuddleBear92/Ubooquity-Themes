{"metadata": [{"type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "NBM", "year": "2015", "description": "For hundreds of thousands of young Americans, after the shock of 9/11, there was Ar Ramadi, Baghdad, Abu Ghraib... The war in Irak. Then came the trauma. Olivier Morel gave them a voice in his compelling documentary On the Bridge. Walking Wounded isn't the book of the documentary but the story of Morel getting close to the young vets, their troubled experience and lives. So close he could not avoid living their trauma himself, seeing all too clearly their vision of the world after their gut-wrenching experiences. From torment to reflection, Morel and artist Mael relate through these vets the impossible return of those who do aspire vividly to get back to a normal life. The effort is huge, some can't make it, others score their own victory by finally turning the corner... a parable for our country's war sickness.\n", "name": "Walking Wounded: Uncut Stories from Iraq"}]}

Colleagues wrestle with their feelings after a confession; an anguished teen wonders about his relationship; a college student finds love unexpectedly close to home; friends reunite after years apart; a salaryman loses himself in the bittersweet memory of first love; a tragedy catalyzes childhood friends' fated connection; and a bike nut discovers something else to go crazy for. Using spare but powerful art and equally engaging dialogue to blend humor and drama, Naoko Momoyama creates a realistic portrayal of love's power.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "DMP", "name": "Love in My Heart"}]}

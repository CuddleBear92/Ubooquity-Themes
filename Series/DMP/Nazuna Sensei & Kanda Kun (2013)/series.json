At the start of the new school year, his ceiling suddenly collapses and dozens of computers, two cats, and a strange man suddenly drop into his apartment. Even more startling, this quirky, childish, and disorganized man is Nazuna-sensei, a teacher at his school! Their unique situation forces the two of them to live together until the ceiling can be repaired. Kanda is annoyed that he's forced to live with a stranger...but can't quite bring himself to hate it. Nazuna Sensei & Kanda Kun follows a teacher who only notices computers and cats, and a student who's noticing him.-------Translated by Leighann Harvey; Edited by Lindley Warmington; Lettered by S.

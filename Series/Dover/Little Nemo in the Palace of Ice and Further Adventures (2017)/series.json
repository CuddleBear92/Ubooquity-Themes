{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "In these strange and marvelously drawn cartoons, a sleeping boy is transported to such fantastic worlds as the Palace of Ice, a pirate ship on the high seas, and a miniature city. Created by a pioneer of cartooning and animation, Little Nemo and his companions provided Sunday entertainment for readers of The New York Herald for nearly a decade. Nemo's escapades swirl in classic dream imagery such as falls, flights, and forests swarming with wild beasts. This lavish hardcover volume recaptures the vintage cartoon's incredibly baroque details and captivating weirdness with 31 full-color pages reproduced from the original 1907 editions.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Dover", "name": "Little Nemo in the Palace of Ice and Further Adventures"}]}

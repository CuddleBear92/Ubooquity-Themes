{"metadata": [{"description": "A troubled woman, barred by her employer from continuing her research, walks miserably through New York City. It takes her a moment to notice that everybody else is looking up. A man has been thrown from the upper floor of the Halo skyscraper. \nAnd that woman-Angela Spica, sick from the transhuman implants she\u2019s buried in her own body-is the only person who can save him. \nWhat she doesn\u2019t know is that the act of saving that one man will tip over a vast and secret house of cards that encloses the entire world, if not the inner solar system. This is how the Wild Storm begins, and it may destroy covert power structures, secret space programs and even all of human history.\nNew York Times best-selling writer Warren Ellis (TRANSMETROPOLITAN, RED, THE AUTHORITY) returns to DC to curate Jim Lee\u2019s WildStorm world, with this debut issue resetting the WildStorm universe with new iterations of Grifter, Voodoo, the Engineer, Jenny Sparks and others.", "name": "The Wild Storm", "year": "2017", "publisher": "DC", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

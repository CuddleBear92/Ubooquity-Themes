{"metadata": [{"description": "RA\u2019S AL GHUL IS DYING\n\nFrom award-winning author Greg Rucka (BATWOMAN, WONDER WOMAN) and comics legend Klaus Janson (BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, Daredevil), BATMAN: DEATH AND THE MAIDENS: THE DELUXE EDITION tells the gripping story of the final days of Ra\u2019s al Ghul.\n\nRa\u2019s al Ghul has lived for hundreds of years, but he is not immortal. Without access to his life-giving Lazarus Pit, death will come to the Demon\u2019s Head just as it would anyone else. Ra\u2019s knows his days are numbered, but his life\u2019s work is far from complete. Time and again the Dark Knight has thwarted him, but now, in his final days, Ra\u2019s must turn to the Batman for help. \n\nIn exchange for his aid, Ra\u2019s offers Batman the opportunity of a lifetime-the chance to speak with his dead parents. But the reunion is not what Batman imagined, and what Martha and Thomas Wayne have to say to their son will profoundly change both the man and the hero. \n\nThis volume includes the complete nine-issue miniseries and prologue story as well as behind-the-scenes sketches and commentary.\n", "name": "Batman: Death & the Maidens", "year": "2003", "publisher": "DC", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

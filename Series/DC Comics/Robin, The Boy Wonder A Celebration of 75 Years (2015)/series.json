{"metadata": [{"description": "So it has been with Batman and his partner in crime, Robin for seventy-five years. The Boy Wonder\u2019s spunk and color balance against the Caped Crusader\u2019s seriousness and gloom to create a perfect partnership, a Dynamic Duo. \n\nThough Batman has always needed a Robin, it hasn\u2019t always been the same Robin. Many different crimefighters have taken up the name and costume, from jovial Dick Grayson to calculating Tim Drake to violent Damian Wayne. Each left his or her mark on the character, and today the Boy Wonder almost as recognizable and beloved as the Dark Knight himself.\n\nCollecting stories from Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Carrie Kelley, Tim Drake, Stephanie Brown, Damian Wayne and more, ROBIN THE BOY WONDER: A CELEBRATION OF 75 YEARS compiles the best moments from seven decades of the Dynamic Duo. It includes Robin\u2019s first appearance by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, as well as tales from industry legends Jim Mooney, Sheldon Moldoff, Frank Miller, Chuck Dixon, Jeph Loeb, Marv Wolfman, Geoge P\u00e9rez, Jim Aparo, Grant Morrison, Andy Kubert and more.\n", "name": "Robin, The Boy Wonder: A Celebration of 75 Years", "year": "2015", "publisher": "DC", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

{"metadata": [{"description": "In the oldest part of Washington, D.C., there sits a vast old mansion with a back door that opens to a small, ordinary garden\u2014but not always. There are times when the garden simply isn\u2019t there, and the door instead leads to eighteenth-century Paris, or feudal England, or a 1930s carnival.\n\n Inside the house lives the reclusive, seemingly ageless aristocrat Baron Winters. He sits out of sight inside his mansion alongside his pet leopard, pulling the strings to bring together a handpicked team of extraordinary individuals\u2014down-on-his-luck tabloid journalist Jack Gold, parapsychology researcher Donovan Caine, and Vanessa Van Helsing, granddaughter of Dracula\u2019s greatest foe.   \n\n Known as the Night Force, the group fights evil wherever\u2014and whenever\u2014Baron Winters sends them.", "name": "Night Force by Marv Wolfman: The Complete Series", "year": "2017", "publisher": "DC", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

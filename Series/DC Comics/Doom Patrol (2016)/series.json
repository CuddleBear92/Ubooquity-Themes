The daydreams crowd sentient streets, and the creative team has been warned, \u201cTurn back now or suffer the mighty consequence of sheer, psycho-maniacal mayhem.\u201d Generation-arsonists unite\u2014this is DOOM PATROL, and the God of the Super Heroes is bleeding on the floor.\n\nA blenderized reimagining of the ultimate series of the strange, DOOM PATROL combines elements from classic runs, new directions, and things that could not be. Our entry point is Casey Brinke, a young EMT on the graveyard shift to abstract enlightenment, with a past so odd that she\u2019s not entirely sure what is real and what is not. Along with her partner, Sam Reynolds, the pair blaze a path through the city and its denizens, finding the only quiet that exists at 3am is the chaos of the brain. When the pair answer a hit-and-run call, they find themselves face to face with a familiar figure: Cliff Steele, AKA Robotman.\n\n\u201cIt gets weirder from here,\u201d writer Gerard Way had to say about the book, with artist Nick Derington gripping tightly on the wheel of the ambulance. The pair\u2019s only communication? Shouting out of the open windows while at high velocity. Who needs a new roommate? Who names a cat \u201cLotion\u201d? And when do we get to see all those muscles?

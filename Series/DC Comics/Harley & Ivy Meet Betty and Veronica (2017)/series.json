{"metadata": [{"description": "Free college tuition for all Riverdale residents?! That\u2019s the plan-after the town drains the wetlands that lie between it and Gotham City and then builds a new campus. The only snag?

Their hijinks are brought to you by the real-life team-up of Paul Dini (HARLEY QUINN) and Marc Andreyko (WONDER WOMAN \u201977), with art by Laura Braga (DC BOMBSHELLS)!", "name": "Harley & Ivy Meet Betty and Veronica", "year": "2017", "publisher": "DC", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

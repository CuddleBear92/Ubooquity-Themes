{"metadata": [{"description": "New York Times best-selling author Daniel H. Wilson delivers a thrilling sci-fi series that raises hard questions about `free will and the nature of good and evil.  \n\nHumanity has discovered the root of all evil: the Malnoro virus-a devastating malady that modifies the neural pathways for empathy. Those infected have been forcibly imprisoned in the Quarantine Zone (whether they choose to do good or evil). Meanwhile, the rest of the cured world is sterile and crime-free, but permeated by an oppressive, paranoid fear of new outbreaks. \n\nIf we could \"\"cure\"\" ourselves of the capability to do evil, should we? And could a person truly be good without the choice to do evil?\"\n", "name": "Quarantine Zone", "year": "2016", "publisher": "DC", "type": "comicSeries"}]}

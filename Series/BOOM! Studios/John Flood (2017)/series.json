Now he brings us John Flood, a series that combines the metaphysical with the procedural in a way we think is really fresh. Joining him is Jorge Coelho, whose fantastic work on Polarity and Sleepy Hollow made him a BOOM! favorite. Perfect for fans of Desolation Jones and Sherlock Holmes. What It Is: As the result of a government experiment, John Flood no longer needs to sleep, but now he's in a constant dream state and sometimes can't tell what's real and what isn't. But a side effect is that he sees patterns and makes connections no one else can, which serve him well in his new \"career\" as a make-shift PI. Together with a burly ex-cop, Flood begins to investigate when he \"sees\" one man responsible for thousands of unsolved murders, but now he himself has caught the killer's attention...", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "BOOM!

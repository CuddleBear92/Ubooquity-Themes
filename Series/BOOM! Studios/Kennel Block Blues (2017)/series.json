{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "\"What's to Love: From Oz to Shawshank Redemption, we just love great prison dramas. But what if the prison in question is an animal shelter? Ryan Ferrier (Curb Stomp) and Daniel Bayliss (Translucid) combine the tradition of great anthropomorphic stories like Wild's End and Blacksad with the madcap twists of Six-Gun Gorilla and The Spire in their new series Kennel Block Blues.\n\nWhat It Is: Oliver is a good dog. A family dog. But without warning, he's sentenced to Jackson Kennel, where he's instantly placed on Death Row with the rest of his fellow inmates, awaiting a lethal appointment on The Table if salvation doesn't come. He'll need help escaping the Kennel, but when the stress of prison life builds, he starts escaping reality instead, imagining a fantasy world of cartoon friends. It's time to break out...into a musical number?\"", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "BOOM! Studios", "name": "Kennel Block Blues"}]}

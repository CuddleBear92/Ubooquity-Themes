{"metadata": [{"year": "2019", "description": "In Nashville, Tennessee lives a man, a recluse, a curmudgeonly highfalutin cartoonist-type who, as a young child, had a penchant for drawing and making up tall tales. It was at the tender age of 18 he turned his back on a promising career in adult film cinematography and followed his heart into the unrewarding comic book industry. Out of desperation, Eric kept drawing, painting, and then creating his own characters and worlds culminating with the beloved series, The Goon. The Art (and Many Other Mistakes) of Eric Powell sheds light on the deliberate and painstaking process of becoming a world-renowned comic book creator as recalled by the artist and a few of his delinquent friends. This extensive art book spotlights never-before-seen childhood drawings, early superhero test pages, film poster art, and the establishment of Powell's homegrown publishing house Albatross (Exploding) Funnybooks. It's also very funny.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "BOOM! Studios", "name": "The Art (and Many Other Mistakes) of Eric Powell"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2016", "description": "WHY BOOM! LOVES IT: Punk rock isn't dead...yet. Turf wars, breaking rules, crushing violence, and Black Flag-these are a few of our favorite things, and we can't wait for Curb Stomp to straight-up knock our teeth out (in a good way). \n\nWHY YOU'LL LOVE IT: Writer Ryan Ferrier (D4VE) is a creator on the rise, and newcomer Devaki Neogi's art will hook you with its aggressiveness but keep you coming back with its heart. Curb Stomp is an unflinching, visceral look at the lengths one woman will go to protect her friends, her family, and her home-perfect for fans of Rat Queens and the seminal '70s cult-favorite film The Warriors. \n\nWHAT IT'S ABOUT: Three gangs. Five girls. No way out. Machete Betty leads a small gang of women under the self-appointed task of protecting their home of Old Beach, one of  three boroughs  surrounding  a  rich  metropolitan  city. When Betty takes the life of a rival gang member in an act of self-defense, she sets off a chain reaction of retaliation, gang warfare, and unlikely allies. It's up to the The Fever-Machete Betty, Derby Girl, Bloody Mary, Daisy Chain, and Violet Volt-to defend their turf at all costs.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "BOOM!

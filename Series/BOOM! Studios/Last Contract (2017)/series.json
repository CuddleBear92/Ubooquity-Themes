{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "\"What's to Love: Last year, John Wick reminded everyone why hitmen make for awesome stories. Of course, we've known that for years as evidenced by The Killer and Hit. Ed Brisson's (Batman & Robin Eternal, Sheltered) take on a retired hit man who finds himself as the target is a calculated thriller that kept us guessing until the end, and newcomer Lisandro Estherren's (Tall Tales from the Badlands) noirish art perfectly sets the mood. \n\nWhat It Is: A retired hit man, known only as \"The Man,\" is forced back into the game when a list of his kills is leaked by a mysterious blackmailer. The list makes targets out of anyone associated with one of the The Man's previous jobs, not to mention The Man himself. As he fights to protect those the list exposes, The Man sets off to uncover the identity of the blackmailer so he can move on with his new life once and for all, but will the truth ruin those chances forever?\"", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "BOOM!

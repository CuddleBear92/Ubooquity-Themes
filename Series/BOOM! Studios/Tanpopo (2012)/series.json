Camilla d'Errico's mythic and mystical take on literature is told through the unfolding narrative of Tanpopo--a mysterious girl guided by Kuro; the devil in disguise. Following from TANPOPO Volume 1 Hardcover, the second hardcover edition continues Tanpopo's journey into human emotion through the works of Shakespeare, Edgar Allen Poe and a foray into the 1001 Arabian Nights.

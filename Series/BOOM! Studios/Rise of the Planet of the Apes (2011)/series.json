{"metadata": [{"year": "2011", "description": "A free online digital comic book prequel to Twentieth Century Fox's epic motion picture RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. The comic, whose story is set before the events detailed in the film, presents an epic tale of two apes brutally taken from the wild and driven into a life of captivity and experimentation - a journey that will alter the fate of the world forever. \n\nAcclaimed PLANET OF THE APES comic series writer Daryl Gregory and sensational artists Damian Couceiro (HAWKS OF OUTREMER) and Tony Parker (DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP?) set the stage for... RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, the first live-action film in the history of movies to star and be told from the point of view of a sentient animal - a character with human-like qualities, who can strategize, organize and ultimately lead a revolution, and with whom audiences will experience a real emotional bond. The film was impossible to make until the technology, invented for Avatar and now advanced to a new dimension, caught up to the idea behind the movie. A new free five page RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES digital comic book story debuts each Wednesday until the final 10 page epic conclusion on August 3rd, two days before the film's release!", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "BOOM!

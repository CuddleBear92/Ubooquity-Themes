Besides being one of our  favorite writers, Michael Alan Nelson is one of the industry's preeminent voices in horror,  and we couldn't be happier to be bringing back his fan-favorite creation HEXED for another dive into the depths of the Aether with an ongoing series!   WHY YOU'LL LOVE IT: Lucifer is the perfect mash-up of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Lara Croft. Plus, HEXED was Pretty Deadly and Amazing SpiderMan superstar Emma Rios' introduction to the American comics scene back in 2008, and new series artist Dan Mora is poised to continue the trend with his lyrical, horrific, and wholly unique take on Lucifer.   WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Luci Jennifer Inacio Das Neves (most people just call her 'Lucifer')  is a supernatural thief-for-hire, stealing wondrous objects from the dark denizens of the  netherworld for her mentor/mother figure, Val Brisendine. But when Lucifer accidentally  unleashes a terrible evil from one of the paintings hanging in Val's art gallery, will any of  the tricks up her sleeve be enough to stop it?", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "BOOM! Studios", "name": "Hexed"}]}

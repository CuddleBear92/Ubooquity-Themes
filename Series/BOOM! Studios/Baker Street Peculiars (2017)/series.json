{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "What's to Love: Roger Langridge (Abigail and the Snowman, The Musical Monsters of Turkey Hollow), who has delighted us with his imaginative all-ages work for years, is teaming up with Andy Hirsch (Adventure Time) to bring us a new twist within the world of Sherlock Holmes. What if the world's greatest detective wasn't quite what he\u2014or she\u2014seemed? \n\nWhat It Is: It's a lovely day in 1930s London, right up until a giant stone lion comes to life and starts wrecking the city! It seems like the perfect case for the world's most famous detective, Sherlock Holmes. Of course, Sherlock Holmes doesn't actually exist; he is a fictional character created by housekeeper Mrs. Hudson, who has been the real detective all along, writing Holmes' adventures under the pen name of John Watson and running around the city in disguise. With an overwhelmed case load she'll need the help of a precocious bunch of young detectives-in-training to solve the mystery of the living statues. Baker Street will never be the same!", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "BOOM! Studios", "name": "Baker Street Peculiars"}]}

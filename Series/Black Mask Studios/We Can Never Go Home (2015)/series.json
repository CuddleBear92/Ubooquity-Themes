{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "\"A well worn mixtape, a stolen convertible, a duffel bag full of cash, a fully loaded .45, and super-powers. 17 and on the run is the only way to see America right.\" Navigating the halls of high school is never easy. And for teenage outcast Duncan and popular girl Madison things are even harder. They share a secret -- they can do things other people can't. But their abilities and need for secrecy take them down a dangerous path. After making a terrible and deadly mistake they are left with no choice. They have to leave and never come back. A blend of crime road stories like True Romance & Badlands, coming of age tales like Pretty In Pink & Ghost World, and \"outcast kids against the world\" books like Runaways & Deadly Class, We Can Never Go Home is a new chance to fall in love with the doomed misfits and the dreamers who set off to find something bigger. We Can Never Go Home is the debut creator-owned book from writers Matthew Rosenberg (12 Reasons To Die / co-writer on Ghostface Killah's new LP 36 Seasons), Patrick Kindlon (hit webcomic Menu / upcoming OGN The Urn), and artist Josh Hood (JLA: Scary Monsters, Venom).", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Black Mask Studios", "name": "We Can Never Go Home"}]}

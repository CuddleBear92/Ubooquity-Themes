{"metadata": [{"year": "2018", "description": "\"What if 'The Smoking Man' from X-Files was a real person, and his daughter found out what he did for a living?\" The daughter of an assassinated globalist kingpin breaks out of an internment camp and leads her fellow escaped prisoners in a battle against an elitist conspiracy of shadow governments, megabanks, and military juntas in this edgy and subversive sci-fi thriller. Incendiary writer Matt Pizzolo (Godkiller, Occupy Comics, Threat) and striking newcomer Amancay Nahuelpan unleash this tour-de-force that fearlessly assaults politics-as-usual. Young Terrorists continues the legacy of DMZ and The Invisibles as it manically rips the scab off life under the new world order and revels in the pus underneath. The 84-page issue 1 prestige-edition launches this new ongoing series, continuing forward with standard-length single issues.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Black Mask Studios", "name": "Young Terrorists"}]}

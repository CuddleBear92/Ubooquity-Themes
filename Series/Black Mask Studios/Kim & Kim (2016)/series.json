{"metadata": [{"year": "2016", "description": "Kim & Kim are twenty-something besties out to make a name for themselves in the wild world of interdimensional cowboy law enforcement. In a massive \"screw you\" to their parents and the authorities, they decide to hijack some high stakes bounty -- and end up in way over their heads. Kim & Kim is a day-glo action adventure that's bursting with energy and enthusiasm. Blending the punk exuberance of TANK GIRL with the buddy adventure wackiness of SUPERBAD (if Michael Cera was a trans woman and Jonah Hill a queer girl partner in crime), Kim & Kim is a bright, happy, punk rock sci-fi adventure that is queer as shit.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Black Mask Studios", "name": "Kim & Kim"}]}

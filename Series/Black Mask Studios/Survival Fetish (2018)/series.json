He's a local celebrity for transporting medicine and information across a no-man's land occupied by militias and street gangs. But what people say about you is never the full story, and when the cheers die out Saheer is left with just his anxieties... and his secrets. The first of a five-issue series that keeps its foot pressed on your adrenal gland. From Patrick Kindlon (We Can Never Go Home, There's Nothing There, S.H.I.E.L.D.: Quake) and illustrator Antonio Fuso (James Bond), Survival Fetish is a pulse-pounding thrill-ride that mixes political intrigue with deep characters and high octane action.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Black Mask Studios", "name": "Survival Fetish"}]}

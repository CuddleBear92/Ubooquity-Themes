{"metadata": [{"year": "2018", "description": "A group of isolated shieldmaidens protect their village against a tide of men who think they can seize land from them. Vif takes her band of women off viking to quell the advances of a loitering mystical scumbag, Bjarte. But some battles rage on inside us long after the field is empty, and some opponents won't ever stay down. Eternal is a haunting story of how vulnerable you make yourself when trying to protect everything around you. With hyperdetailed art and gorgeous fluid motion from artist Eric Zawadzki [hot off THE DREGS], this story will be one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking things you will read this year.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Black Mask Studios", "name": "ETERNAL"}]}

{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "A sci-fi thriller about a next-gen form of psychiatry: \"subliminal hitmen\" injected into your mind who hunt down and kill the demons that haunt you. Ex-military sharpshooter Colin McClure is Mezign Corporation's most recent recruit for the still-experimental (and often deadly) job of subliminal hitman. McClure is the perfect candidate for two reasons: a) he's a killing machine, and b) he lost his legs in the war, so subliminal-ops are his only way to see any action. But he's also a dangerous candidate for one reason unknown to Mezign: Colin's true motive is to enter the mind of his catatonic daughter and bring her out of a coma.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Black Mask Studios", "name": "X'ed"}]}

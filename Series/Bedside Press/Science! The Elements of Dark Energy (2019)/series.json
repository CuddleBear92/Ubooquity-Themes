{"metadata": [{"year": "2019", "description": "\"Science! is the story of Tamsin Kuhn Trakroo, a fourteen-year-old girl who is already the smartest Theoretical and Applied Physicist in any room. Yeah, she\u2019s that super smart! Tamsin has just started studying at The Prometheus Institute which is only the world\u2019s most famous and prestigious science school. The Institute is a futuristic wonderland filled with genius teachers (some who might not be of this world), and floating helper robots known as S.T.A.T.s. \n\nBut Tamsin is stressed, and if your dead father talked to you through your super-cool science glasses, you\u2019d be stressed out too. That\u2019s right, her father, the world-renowned Dr. Thomas Trakroo uploaded his consciousness before his death and now lives as a hologram stored in Tamsin\u2019s glasses.\n\nHer father claims that Lucan Laveran, headmaster of The Prometheus Institute, is his murderer, and is on a mission to destroy the Institute! But Lucan just offered Tamsin a really cool position as his assistant. He can\u2019t be a murderer, right? Can she trust her weird holographic Dad?\n\nTamsin\u2019s really cute roommate, Garyn, is the only one that she can trust right now. However, Garyn\u2019s just discovered a dangerous energy source that could win her the Prometheus Institute Award for Superior Science, or it could tear a hole in the very space/time continuum!\"", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Bedside Press", "name": "Science!: The Elements of Dark Energy"}]}

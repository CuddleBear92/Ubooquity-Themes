Crashing his canoe on the shores of Chaqua, Brok discovers the powers of the island have changed him, increasing his growth exponentially each night - and without a cure it will shortly kill him! Teaming up with Torgon, the son of the deposed leader of a technologically advanced Blackpaw tribe living on the island, and the mysterious Starra, the imprisoned grand-daughter of an ancient ghost, Brok sets out to find a cure.

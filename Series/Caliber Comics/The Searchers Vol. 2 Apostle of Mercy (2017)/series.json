Wells, Jules Verne, Arthur Conan Doyle, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and H Rider Haggard were created. Sherlock Holmes, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, The Invisible Man, Journey to the Center of the Earth, The Time Machine, The Island of Dr. Moreau. All thought to be the work of pure fiction over the years by the public. However Charles Fort, the famous collector of all things bizarre and supernatural, had discovered an ancient book that when opened manifests the ideas in one's mind into reality. And in the presence of these great writers the world as we know it was changed forever. A century later, the descendants of those famous adventurers are recruited by the legendary Professor Challenger in order to stop the book from being opened again...and irreversibly changing the present. Now London\u2019s burning! Martian war machines terrorize the capital! And Geneva Walcott Fogg is running for her life! But this awesome, destructive power does not come from outer space - its vile roots are much closer to home. This continues the extraordinary change in Geneva\u2019s life and draws closer to a major new player in the Searchers universe.

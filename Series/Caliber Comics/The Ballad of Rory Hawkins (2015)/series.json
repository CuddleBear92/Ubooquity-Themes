{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "A tale of murder, motorcycle gangs, Charlie Manson, and the man who starred as TV's Marshal Hondo Bradley. California in the summer of '69 was a place of free love and hippie communes. But when Korean War Veteran and novelist Rory Hawkins spends the day interviewing George Clayton, former star of the hit TV western series Outlaw Pass, things take an unexpected turn when they cross paths with Charlie Manson at the Spahn movie ranch. Though this comic series is fiction many of the characters are real, and the story is rooted in historical fact, specifically Manson's desire to target celebrities for violence and his infamous residence at the Spahn movie ranch. Also, this series takes place during a very specific historical timeline (Saturday, August 2 - Monday, August 11, 1969), and the events are intertwined with the Sharon Tate and LaBianca family murders that took place during those days. It features meticulously research on the Manson murders and the narrative has been developed in a way so that the events in the story could be historically plausible and a resolution is reached without contradicting the historical record.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Caliber Comics", "name": "The Ballad of Rory Hawkins"}]}

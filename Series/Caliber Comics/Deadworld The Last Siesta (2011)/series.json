Outside of the dusty and remote town of Juarez, Mexico, new laws have replaced what was once called civilization.

One of the wielders of this new law was the mysterious wanderer, Raga, who was known in the whispers swirling around the land as simply, \"The Assassin.\" There was nothing living... or dead, that he hadn't killed. But now he had a new challenge. However, his plans get disrupted by an unexpected force - the King Zombie and his hoards of zombies! You may be able to kill what's already dead, but how many times?", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Caliber Comics", "name": "Deadworld: The Last Siesta"}]}

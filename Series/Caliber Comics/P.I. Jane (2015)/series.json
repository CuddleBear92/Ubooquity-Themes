Investigations, which operates out of the owner, Margaret \u201cPeggy\u201d Woodward\u2019s suburban home, and is entirely staffed by women. Under the guise of a knitting club called the \u201cStitch & Bitch,\u201d Peggy\u2019s girls meet once a week. The other P.I.\u2018s are assigned run-of-the-mill cases: insurance fraud, infidelity, nanny watching-- the usual. Jane\u2019s cases, though? They\u2019re a little... different.

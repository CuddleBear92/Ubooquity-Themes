{"metadata": [{"year": "2016", "description": "Remembered as the father of modern horror, H.P. Lovecraft is best known for tales of terror, cosmic abominations and especially his most famous creation, the dreaded Cthulhu! Few realize, however, the true creative breadth and depth spanned by Lovecraft, who penned stories of horror but also of fantasy, science fiction and even humor. Within this Mythos series, writer Brandon Barrows and artist Hugo Petrus go beyond tentacles and evil gods to explore the rare corners and the myriad worlds created by H.P. Lovecraft!  This issue: \"Pickman's Model\" - Richard Pickman, an artist of notoriously-ghastly works so horrifying that he's been ostracized from Boston's artistic society, knows the anatomy of fear better than anyone else alive - but how? \"The Strange High House in the Mist\" - Thomas Olney, a jaded philosopher, has a obsession: the strange, mist-shrouded house on the cliffs above Kingsport. When he can stand his curiosity no longer, he sets out to visit the house.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Caliber Comics", "name": "Mythos"}]}

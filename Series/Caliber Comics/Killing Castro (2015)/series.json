{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "A black satirical comedy if only it wasn't true. In the sweltering summer of 1963, at the height of Cold War paranoia, CIA agent Robert \"Bob\" Maheu is sent to Cuba on a suicide mission aptly titled Operation Good Times: to humiliate Fidel Castro during a live television broadcast by dosing the dictator with LSD and making his beard fall out.  But Bob bears the permanent scars of the MKULTRA program, a dark secret in the untold history of the United States' clandestine services. Overseeing Bob's mission back home is Dr. Gottlieb, the mad mastermind behind the MK-Ultra program which tried to turn Americans like Bob into remote-controlled killing machines. But as the devious doctor discovers, Bob's humanity and his red-white-&-blue birthright to freedom and individuality remain just beneath the surface of his sock-puppet skin. This is the (mostly) true story of how one agency's epic failure set the United States on a collision course with paranoia and peace. \"Jason Ciaccia's tale of LSD-crazed assassins would seem ridiculously hypernplic if it weren't derived from the CIA's own files...Aaron Norhanian's ferivd ink drawings propel this witty hybrid of underground comix and the History Channel right of the top.\" - R.C. Baker, The Village Voice.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Caliber Comics", "name": "Killing Castro"}]}

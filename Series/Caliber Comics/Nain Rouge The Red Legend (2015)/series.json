{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "Evil lerks in the Motor City and a little known folklore tale is revealed. Elly and Tom are two average middle schoolers on a field trip to the Detroit Institute of Arts. But this typical field trip takes a dangerous turn as they encounter a mysterious creature called The Nain Rouge.  As the \u201cSteward of Straits\u201d, the Nain Rouge (French meaning 'Red Dwarf') was responsible for keeping harmony and balance in the natural world near the straits of the great river in what is now Detroit and Windsor Canada.  But the early French settlers refused to go along with the old ways of the new world...and the curse of The Nain Rouge began. \"By weaving very adult issues of downturns, job loss, and recession-effect on families with this dark fantasy tale, Bastian has created a bogeyman we can all believe in - along with a hero and heroine who just might have the drive and energy to turn the city around.\" \u2013 Amazon Review", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Caliber Comics", "name": "Nain Rouge: The Red Legend"}]}

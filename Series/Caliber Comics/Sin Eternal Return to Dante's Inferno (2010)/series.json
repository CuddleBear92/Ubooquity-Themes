{"metadata": [{"year": "2010", "description": "Sin Eternal is more than just a re-tooling of the immortal classic, Dante's Inferno. It plants itself firmly in the modern world and away from the political crimes that dominated Dante's work. Sin Eternal brings a very basic questioning of a man's faith as he witnesses some of the most horrendous punishments that could be exacted. The story covers the travels of a man who is sent to hell to examine the various torments and punishments that the sinners of Earth are forced to face each moment of eternity. From the slovenly gluttons to the fates of the suicides, from the heretics to the thieves, a variety of different levels are covered. From the ferry of Charon, the man is taken into the very depths of evil. And all is not as it appears.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Caliber Comics", "name": "Sin Eternal: Return to Dante's Inferno"}]}

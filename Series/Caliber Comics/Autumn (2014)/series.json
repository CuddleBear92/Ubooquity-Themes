As German bombs pummel the city of London, the leaves of autumn begin to fall and so do the victims.  A young boy's fascination with a local serial killer will plunge himself into a life-long obsession. The story of Autumn is a number of things: a coming of age story, a tale of revenge, a study in obsession, and a post war Gothic horror story. Set in and under London, the main characters are not the victims, the hero, or even the serial killer, but the dark labyrinth underground. After nine years of autumnal atrocities, James Turrell descends into the black abyss of the Underground, believing himself fully prepared and ready to confront the object of his obsession. But he is wrong...", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Caliber Comics", "name": "Autumn"}]}

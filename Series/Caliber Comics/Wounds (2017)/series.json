{"metadata": [{"year": "2017", "description": "Is madness a way to survive the zombie apocalypse? \"Wounds\" is a father\u2019s attempt to save his family. Or a science fiction story about a family in an orbiting ark. Or one man\u2019s descent into madness accompanied by Death in a tuxedo. Or a fever dream by a Black Death sufferer. Take your pick! Gary Scott Beatty (\"Jazz: Midnight,\" \"Worlds,\" \"Number One\") drops us into a world where nothing is beyond doubt, except a father's concern for his wife and daughter. If you enjoy that \"What th-?\" factor in graphic novels, you'll enjoy \"Wounds.\" All will be explained.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Caliber Comics", "name": "Wounds"}]}

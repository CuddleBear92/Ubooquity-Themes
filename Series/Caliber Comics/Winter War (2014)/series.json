{"metadata": [{"year": "2014", "description": "Winter War is about the 100 day war of Finland against the invading Soviet Union army at the dawn of World War II. Sniper Tero Toivanent answers the call from his homeland, Finland, when it's attacked by the USSR, which seeks a buffer zone against Nazi Germany. Although the Soviets anticipated a quick victory against the small Finnish army made up of largely citizen soldiers, the Finns used the advantage of their winter to hold off the Soviets for an amazing four months. In this fictionalized account, but based on real situations, Tero and his allies, Niklas and Manu, are deployed to southern Finland to stop the Russian division attacking over the frozen Lake Hirvasj\u00e4rvi. Seeing plenty of death and destruction and the hopelessness a Finnish winter can bring, the three get a taste of the horrors of war. Will it be enough to freeze even their hearts, accustomed to the deepest cold?", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Caliber Comics", "name": "Winter War"}]}

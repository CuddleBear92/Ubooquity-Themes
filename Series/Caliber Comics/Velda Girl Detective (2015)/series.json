{"metadata": [{"year": "2015", "description": "\"Velda: Girl Detective\" is a multileveled representation of the more lurid of the 1950s crime comics and presented as if it actually existed as a classic Golden Age comic.  Velda is more than a passing homage to the noir films and hard-boiled detective school of writing of the 1950s as it included in issues special features such as a  Velda paper doll kit and the complete 1955 Velda pinup calendar to provide authenticity. The comics also include vintage parody ads as well as short story featurettes such as \"Hawkshaw Hawk, Bird Detective\" and \"Neolithica: Girl of the Pleistocene\" to entertain readers. In this exciting 1st issue: Velda is awakened from her wholly unnecessary beauty sleep to solve a brutal murder in the \"Case of the Homicide Hotel\"! Also in this issue: Velda chases a thief in \"Butter Safe Than Sorry\" and a larcenous dentist in \"Velda Does a Favor.\" As a bonus an adventure of Neolithica: Girl of the Pleistocene and Hawkshaw Hawk: Bird Detective round out the issue.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Caliber Comics", "name": "Velda: Girl Detective"}]}

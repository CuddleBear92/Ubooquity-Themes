Wells, Jules Verne, Arthur Conan Doyle, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and H Rider Haggard were created. Sherlock Holmes, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, The Invisible Man, Journey to the Center of the Earth, The Time Machine, The Island of Dr. Moreau. All thought to be the work of pure fiction over the years by the public.

And in the presence of these great writers the world as we know it was changed forever. Now, a century later, the descendants of those famous adventurers are recruited by the legendary Professor Challenger in order to stop the book from being opened again...and irreversibly changing the present.  \"Searchers is the comic book I have on the wall with a sign reading - 'Love books?

{"metadata": [{"year": "2018", "description": "Prepare for a new hero. A hero that has tasted the stench of evil's darkness yet has also touched the goodness in men's hearts. A hero that rewards as well as punishes. A hero that battles street crimes as well as that which crosses supernatural dimensions. The hero is NIGHTLINGER and the shadows are his domain. And joining him is his sexy female assistant, Mike who keeps Nightlinger embedded in the realm of humanity. From one troubled person to the next the plain black business cards with the gold lettering are passed. \"I had a problem like yours once,\" the donor confesses. \"This card got me out of it.\" There is only an address on the card, to the Haunted Bookshop in Minneapolis, where a fat man named Stick sits behind the counter. This fat man will patiently listen to your tale of woe, may even ask you a question or two, but in the end all he will do is wish you well, leaving you nothing to do except to go home. Sometimes nothing happens to rectify a problem; more often than not, the predicament is resolved. Permanently. In the latter case a letter appears in your mail requesting a small donation to support the Haunted Bookshop. Most folks are only too happy to comply.

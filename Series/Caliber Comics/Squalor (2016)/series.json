{"metadata": [{"year": "2016", "description": "\"Quiet Island\" Welcome to A-Time, not another dimension, not a parallel world, but your very own neighborhood bereft of linear time! Here, past, present and future merge like expressway off-ramps. Here, bestial six legged Quirks can alter the future, Glitches of powerful emotion swarm once-stable lives, and Archetypes leave (big) footprints. After a nervous breakdown, genius double-doctorate Harry Keller wasn\u2019t looking for A-Time, but he found it. Like many explorers before him, he soon learns that the terra incognita is dazzling and dangerous, because whatever happens in A-Time also has an effect here, from benign to devastating. And, just like those explorers, Harry Keller thinks he\u2019s the first. Discovering that an ex-junkie\u2019s suicide is linked to millions of future death, Harry takes the poor sap into A-Time, only to have to go mano-a-mano with a Quirk determined to make sure that someone off themselves \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t care who! Squalor is best-selling author Stefan Petrucha\u2019s 1989 comic book debut, with art by the late, great Tom Sutton, at his quirky best, psychedelic colors by Paul Mounts and eye-popping cover by Jeffrey K. Potter, known for his work for Analog and Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction magazines.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Caliber Comics", "name": "Squalor"}]}

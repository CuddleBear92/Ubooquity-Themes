{"metadata": [{"year": "2019", "description": "It all begins here. The epic fantasy series for those that enjoy Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, Dungeons and Dragons, and Game of Thrones. Here is the introductory issue and sets the stage for the magic and Middle Earth adventures that will be unveiled. Four normal modern day teenagers are plunged into a world they thought only existed in novels and film. They are whisked away to a magical land where dragons roam the skies, orcs and hobgoblins terrorize weary travelers, dark magic consumes kingdoms, and where unicorns prance through the forest. It is a world where man is just one race, joining other races such as elves, trolls, dwarves, changelings, and the dreaded creatures who steal the night. This is not a typical \"dungeons and dragons\" world, for this world follows the adventures of these wayward teens into the unknown as we watch the world unfold in front of their (and our) eyes. Luckily for some of them, they are saved and then joined by an escaped slave, the female elven named Silverfawn. It was a world of magic, of enchantment, of adventure and of death.", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "Caliber Comics", "name": "The Realm, Vol. 1"}]}

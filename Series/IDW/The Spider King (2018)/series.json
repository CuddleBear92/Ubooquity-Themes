Equal parts science fiction and fantasy, The Spider King follows the adventures of Viking warriors as they defend their world against alien invaders armed with futuristic technology and impossible weapons in this clash of genres. It takes all of the best aspects of medieval fantasy and science fiction, and smashes them together to create an unexpected twist on two well worn stories.\n", "type": "comicSeries", "publisher": "IDW", "name": "The Spider King"}]}

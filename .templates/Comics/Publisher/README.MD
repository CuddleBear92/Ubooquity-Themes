# How to use the template/example

Use only What you need here.

HTML is only really needed if there is a header.jpg file to use.

The .css file is only needed when you want to change the background colour and text colour of the page itself.

an !important flag is needed to force the .css to be used, otherwise it will use the theme colours (like darkmode B).


Please use square images for publishers folder.jpg files!

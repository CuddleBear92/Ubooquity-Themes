# comixology-to-ubooquity.py
Requires Python3
Requires Requests, beautifulsoup4 and html5lib

Use --scrape-series to scrape series pages and images aswell as publishers.
Use -d/--destination to set destination
Use -D for request delays in seconds.
-ss to skip series folders.
-sp to skip publisher folders.

Set Requests on a timer of atleast 2 sec unless you are willing to risk getting blocked (a VPN might be smart if you set no limits)
A full scrape can take a day or two.

Example of run: `python3 comixology-to-ubooquity.py --scrape-series -D 1 3 -ss -sp -d "/volume1/Comics/CUexport/"`


If the script give you an error mid run, please make an issue about it.
Clearing out the Publisher or Series folder (depending on your skip settings) and retrying the script will prob work if everything is setup correctly.

Note the script makes an extra un-needed folder for all the publisher images, this is not required with v2 of the Comixology theme but could be used for those that use v1... for some reason.

# Cover_Extract_0.5.py
Extracts Files marked as cover in the ComicRack .xml metadata files inside of archives.


# find_nonwebp.py
Finds archives with jpegs and other image formats that ISN'T WebP inside the archive.
Generates a Comicbook List you can import into ComicRack.
This is made cause there is no easy way to filter or find these files inside of ComicRack, this is for cleanup.

# testarchives.pl
Requires Perl to run. https://www.perl.org/get.html
Just open with Perl in Windows or run with CMD or similar.
Verifies the state of archives and writes text file with all corrupt archives. (might be able to be edited to make CBL list file for Comicrack)

# UCC
Backup of the Generator
Generates Comic Story arcs, Authors and Book Series.

##cvinfogen.py and bat
Generates the cvinfo file for mylar to use to match with out of the Exported CVID ComicRack can export.
This makes matching flawless when you match correct in CR and names with the orgnaizer.
Made to be used with Python3, just `python cvinfogen PATH-TO-COMICS`.
you can also launch with -f to force and overwrite so it will overwrite if something was wrong or files where already in place (from mylar for example)

##importer.py & librarysync.py
importer.py & librarysync.py will use the folder name as is without touching it, this is broken on the normal mylar release.
This allows you to have any comic structure in mylar for easy use.
On the normal release it would make and map to a folder ruled by the rename rules, even if the renaming was turned off.
This just allows it to match correct no matter the folder name or the folder naming format (as it doesnt create anymore).

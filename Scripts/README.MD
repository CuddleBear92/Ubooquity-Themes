Requires Python3
Requires Requests, beautifulsoup4 and html5lib

Use --scrape-series to scrape series pages and images aswell as publishers.
Use -d/--destination to set destination
Use -D for request delays in seconds.
-ss to skip series folders.
-sp to skip publisher folders.

Set Requests on a timer of atleast 2 sec unless you are willing to risk getting blocked (a VPN might be smart if you set no limits)
A full scrape can take a day or two.

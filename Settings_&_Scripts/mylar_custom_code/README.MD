importer.py will use the folder name as is without touching it, this is broken on the normal mylar release.
This allows you to have any comic structure in mylar for easy use.
On the normal release it would make and map to a folder ruled by the rename rules, even if the renaming was turned off.
This just allows it to match correct no matter the folder name or the folder naming format (as it doesnt create anymore).
